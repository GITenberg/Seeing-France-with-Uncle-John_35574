<h2> I </h2>

<p class="center">YVONNE TO HER MOTHER</p>
<br>

<p class="rthead"><i>Second day out at sea.</i></p>

<p><span class = "dropcap">D</span><span class="smcap">ear Mama</span>: We did get
off at last, about four in the
afternoon, but you never imagined
anything like the day we had
with Uncle John. It was awful, and,
as luck would have it, he just happened
to go aft or sou'west, or whatever it is
on shipboard, in time to see them drop<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
his trunk into the hold, and they let it
fall from such a height that he swore for
an hour. I don't see why Uncle is so
unreasonable; a Russian gentleman had
the locks broken to both his trunks and
just smiled, and a very lovely Italian
lady had her trunk caved in by the hoisting-rope
and only shrugged her shoulders;
but Uncle turned the whole deck
fairly black and blue on account of a
little fall into the hold. If Lee had
only been along to soothe him down!
But Lee is in London by this time. I
do think he might have waited and gone
with us, but Uncle says he's glad he
didn't, because he says he has more than
half an idea that Lee's in love with me,
and that no girl alive could be happy
with him. I wish Uncle liked Lee<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
better. I wish Lee wouldn't slap him
on the back and call him "old boy" the
way he does.</p>

<p>Mrs. Clary doesn't like it because she
has to sit next to the doctor and talk
English to him, and he can't talk English.
She says whenever she goes on
board a liner the doctor always spots
her as intelligent-looking, and has her put
next to him for English purposes. She says
she's made seven trips as nursery-governess
to a doctor with linguistic
aspirations. The consequence is, she
has most of her meals on deck with a
man named Mr. Chopstone. Uncle
doesn't like Mr. Chopstone, because he
says he has a sneaking suspicion that
Mr. Chopstone admires Edna. He says
Edna could never be happy with a man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
like Mr. Chopstone.</p>

<p>More later.</p><br>

<p class="rthead"><i>Fourth day out.</i></p>
<p><span class="smcap">I've</span> been writing Lee; I can mail it at
Plymouth. It does seem to me as if Lee
might have waited and gone with us.</p>

<p>We are nicely adjusted now, and Uncle
has had his trunk brought to his
room, and has examined the corners and
found them intact; so now the trunk is
off his mind. But he has almost had
fits over a man named Monsieur Sibilet,
so the situation has been about as brimstony
as ever. M. Sibilet is a Frenchman
going back to France, but his chair
is next to Mrs. Clary's, and Uncle says
steamer-chairs are never accidents, but
are always premeditated and with intent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
to kill. He asked Mrs. Clary if she
couldn't see that no woman could ever
be happy with a dancing fan-tan like
Sibilet. We didn't know what a "fan-tan"
was, but we all agreed with Uncle's
premises as to poor monsieur; and then
it developed that there is a Mme. Sibilet
deathly sick down below, and Uncle
said that he had known it all the time
and was only joking.</p>

<p>Edna and Harry are very happy, but
they have to be awfully careful, because
Uncle says he has a half-fledged notion
that Harry is paying attention to Edna,
and that he won't allow anything of the
kind&mdash;not for one York second. We
don't know what a "York second" is,
and we haven't asked. Uncle plays
poker nights, and we make the most of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
it. There is a nice Yale man on board,
and I walk around with him. His name
is Edgar. Uncle says he looks as if he
had his bait out for a fortune, but Mrs.
Clary says to never mind it&mdash;to go right
on walking. She lies still while we
walk, ande talks to M. Sibilet in French.</p>

</div>


<p>Uncle says he is the head of this expedition,
and there's to be no foolishness.
He says it's all rot about a man
not being able to see through women,
and that Edna and I needn't expect to
keep any secrets from him. I do wish
Lee was here to soothe him down. He
was so furious to-day because he shut up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
his wash-stand and let the tooth-powder
slide to perdition. M. Sibilet offered
him an extra box of his own, but Uncle
wasn't a bit grateful. He says he is
sure M. Sibilet is in love with Mrs.
Clary now, or why under the sun should
he offer him his tooth-powder? He says
he thinks it's disgraceful, considering
poor Mme. Sibilet, and he took mine
instead.</p>

<p>More later.</p>
<br>

<p class="rthead"><i>Sixth day out.</i></p>
<p><span class="smcap">I do wish</span> we were in Havre, or anywhere
where Uncle had more room.
The third officer invited him up on the
bridge yesterday, and Uncle says you
needn't tell him that any third officer
in this world ever would invite him up
to the bridge unless he had his eye on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
Edna or me. Uncle says for Edna and
me to remember that old uncles have
eyes as well as young third officers, and
to bear in mind that it would be a dog's
life to be married to a third officer.
I'm beginning to be very glad, indeed,
that Lee took another steamer; I reckon
Lee saw how it would be. Uncle says
he'd like to know what we took a slow
steamer for, anyhow. He says it would
have been more comfortable to have all
been in death agonies and to have been
in Havre by this time. He was terribly
upset to-day by Mme. Sibilet's coming
on deck and proving to be an old lady
with white hair and the mother of monsieur
instead of the wife. He says you
needn't talk to him about French honor
after this. We don't know what the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
connection is between poor old Mme.
Sibilet and French honor, but we think
it best not to ask. The truth is, Uncle
lost all patience with M. Sibilet the day
it rained and pitched&mdash;I think it was the
third day out. He never did like him
very much, anyhow. Mrs. Clary wanted
to sit in the wind that day, and she and
monsieur sat in the wind until the rain
grew so bad that they were absolutely
driven to come around and sit by Uncle,
under the lee of the port, or whatever it
is on board ship. Monsieur lugged Mrs.
Clary's chair because he couldn't find a
steward, and he brought it around by the
smoking-room and the whole length of
the deck, with the steamer pitching so
that half the time he was on top of the
chair, and the other half of the time the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
chair was on top of him. There was
no one on deck but us, on account of
the storm, and I thought we should die
laughing, because there were forty
empty chairs under shelter already.
Uncle waited until, with a final slip and
a slide, the poor man landed the chair,
and then he screamed: "I say, Sibbilly,
just take the cards out and change <i>them</i>
another time. That's the way we
Americans do."</p>

<p>You should have seen poor monsieur's
face! Uncle said the whole affair
gave him a queer feeling as to what
might be in store for us in France. He
said if M. Sibilet was a sample Frenchman,
he thought he wouldn't get off at
Havre, after all.</p>

<p>Mrs. Clary is in lots of trouble over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
the doctor. He comes up on deck and
bothers her half to death, talking English.
She can't understand his English,
and M. Sibilet gets tired translating. M.
Sibilet speaks seven languages. Uncle
says that's nothing to his credit, however.</p>

<p>More later.</p>

<p class="rthead"><i>Ninth day out.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Uncle</span> is in high spirits to-day, for
he won the pool. He has been so disgusted
because Mr. Edgar has won it
three times. Uncle says that's no sign
he'd be a good husband, though. I do
think Uncle's logic is so very peculiar.
He came into my state-room to-day and
asked me if I didn't think the doctor
was absolutely impertinent in the way<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
he was pursuing Mrs. Clary. You'd
have thought the doctor tore after her
around the deck, to hear him. He said
he expected to have trouble with Edna
and me, but he never looked for Mrs.
Clary to be a care. He said he didn't
suppose she was over forty, but she ought
to consider appearances more. He was
quite put out, and I am gladder than ever
that Lee isn't with us.</p>

<p>We laughed ourselves half sick to-day
over Mr. Chopstone. Uncle's port-hole
doesn't work very easily, and Mr.
Chopstone heard him talking about it
to himself as he passed in the corridor,
and he went in to help him. Uncle
asked Mr. Chopstone if he had a crow-bar
or a monkey-wrench with him, and
Mr. Chopstone didn't have a crow-bar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
or a monkey-wrench with him, but said
why not ring for the steward. Uncle
wouldn't hear to the steward, and so
they climbed on the divan together and
tried to pry it with Uncle's hair-brush.</p>

<p>The hair-brush broke, and Uncle
went spinning, but Mr. Chopstone
caught his cuff in the crack, and it tore,
and half of his shirt-sleeve with a diamond
cuff-link went to sea. At first
we all felt awful about it, but he was so
composed that Edna said he must be a
millionaire, and Uncle said it must be a
paste diamond. That is all only preliminary
to the funny part. This afternoon
we were lying in our chairs and
Uncle was standing by the rail looking
at a ship. All of a sudden he exclaimed,
"Great Scott! Chopstone, if there isn't<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
your cuff!" Mr. Chopstone made just
one bound from his chair to the rail, and
looked over so hard that his cap fell into
the sea. Of course the mere idea of
the cuff having sailed as fast as we did
all day used us up completely, and Uncle
in particular had to hang to the rail
for support while he sort of wove back
and forth in an ecstasy of speechless joy.
Even M. Sibilet was overcome by mirth,
although it turned out afterward that he
thought the fun was on account of the
lost cap. And then, when we got ourselves
selves under control once more, Mr.
Chopstone explained that what he had
thought was that the cuff had caught
somewhere on the outside of the
steamer and that Uncle saw it hanging
there. Edna says that it all shows that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
poor Mr. Chopstone is <i>not</i> a millionaire,
and Mrs. Clary says it proves, too, that
it <i>was</i> a real diamond.</p>

<p>It is beginning to seem like a pretty
long trip, and Mrs. Clary has started
packing her trunk. The little flag that
marks our progress across the chart is
making Europe in great jumps, and we
are all glad. Uncle gets more restless
every day, and he says if the doctor
don't quit coming up on deck to talk
to Mrs. Clary, something will soon
drop. The doctor is really very amusing;
he says the first officer has a pet
"marmadillo," but we cannot see it
because it is too anxious. He means
"frightened," it seems. Mr. Edgar is
very nice; both he and Mr. Chopstone
are going to Paris. Lee will be in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
Paris by Wednesday, I hope, and I most
sincerely trust he will keep on the right
side of Uncle.</p>

<p>They say we will land early day after
to-morrow. I can mail my letters in
Plymouth to-morrow evening. Uncle
says he's going express hereafter; he
says no more dilly-dally voyages for him.</p><br>


<p class="rthead"><i>Tenth day out.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">What</span> do you think! Uncle took me
into the parlor after dinner to-night
and told me that he wasn't going to
Paris with the rest. He says he didn't
come abroad to scurry around like a
wild rabbit, and that he's going to stop
in Havre for a day or two. He says
Edna and I had better stay with him,
as he can't think of our traveling with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
Mr. Edgar and Mr. Chopstone alone.
I said, "But there's Mrs. Clary." And
he said, "Yes; but you forget Sibbilly."
I do think Uncle's logic is so remarkable.</p><br>


<p class="rthead"><i>Eleventh day out.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Everybody</span> is getting their trunks in
from the baggage-room and running to
the rail to look at ships. Uncle won
the pool again to-day; he says this is one
of the pleasantest trips he ever made, and
he shook hands with M. Sibilet when
he met him on deck this morning.</p>

<p>Mrs. Clary is awfully upset over our
staying in Havre, and she says if Lee is
in Paris he won't like it, either. We
expect a mail in Plymouth.</p><br>


<p class="rthead"><i>Later.</i></p>

<p>The mail came, and I had a letter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
from Lee. He is going to Russia for a
week, and he folded in an extra piece,
saying to give Uncle the letter. It was
a funny kind of letter, but of course it
had to be a funny kind of letter if I was
to give it to Uncle. I gave it to Uncle,
and he said, "Hum!" and that was all.
He says if Mr. Edgar or Mr. Chopstone
stay in Havre he'll know the reason
why. I do think Uncle might be more
reasonable. Edna has been crying. She
doesn't want to stay in Havre; she
wants to go to Paris when Harry goes.</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">"W</span><span class="smcap">ell</span>, girls, are you ready to
get up and out and set about
improving your minds? I've
been reading the guide-book and spilling
my coffee with trying to do two
things at once, ever since eight o'clock.
But what your Uncle John doesn't
know about Rouen now isn't worth
stopping to look up in the index.
Why, I've even got the real French
twang to the pronunciation. It's Rooank;
only you stop short of the 'n'
and the 'k,' so to speak. The waiter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
who brought my breakfast showed me
how to do it&mdash;said he never saw a foreigner
catch on to the trick so quick
before. I gave him one of those
slim little quarters they have here, and
he was so pleased that he taught me
how to say 'Joan of Arc' for nothing.
It's Shondark&mdash;<i>Shondark</i>. I learned it
in no time. Well, come on, if you're
ready. I've been waiting almost an
hour.</p>

<p>"I declare, but this fresh, free atmosphere
is refreshing! As soon as you get
outside of your bedroom door you begin
to get the full benefit of the Continental
climate. I presume, if you're
poor, you get it as soon as you get outside
of your bed clothes. Rather a medieval<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
staircase, eh? And four orange-trees
at the bottom to try and fool us
into feeling balmy. However, I don't
mind little discomforts: all I mind is
being shut up on a ship with a darned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
fool like that man Sibbilly. I shouldn't
wonder if his mother was his wife, after
all. I could believe anything of him.
I didn't like him.</p>

<p>"We'll go to take in the cathedral
first; it isn't far, and I've got it all by
heart. Thirteenth century and unsymmetrical&mdash;you
must remember that.
There, that's it ahead there&mdash;with the
scaffolding. They're bolstering it up
somewhat, so as to keep on hooking
tourists, I presume. The biggest tower
is the Butter Tower, built out of paid-for
permissions to eat butter in Lent.
Rather a rough joke, its being so much
the biggest, isn't it? The whole cathedral's
lopsided from eating butter, so to
speak. I believe it's the thing to stop
in front and act as if you were overcome;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
so we'll just call a halt here and
take in the general effect of the scaffolding.</p>

<p>"Now we'll walk around the whole
thing. I haven't come abroad to take
life with a hop, skip, and jump; I've
come to be thorough, and I want you
girls to form the habit of being thorough,
too. What I didn't like about
that fellow Edgar was his not being
thorough. When he went down to
look at the ship's machinery he only
stayed an hour. Now, I didn't go
at all; but if I had gone, I should
have stayed more than an hour. Good
job of scaffolding, isn't it? You see,
they make the scaffolding out of young
trees withed together, and use them
over and over. Economical. Just<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
about what you'd expect of Sibbilly.
Those gargoyles and saints around the
top stick their heads out pretty interested-like,
don't they? But their view
is for the most part blocked. Now this
cheerful old jail at the back is the palace
of the archbishop. I wish, young
ladies, that you would note those little
bits of high windows and the good
thick bars across them as illustrating the
secure faith that the dead and gone archbishops
had in their loving people. I'll
bet there's been plenty of battering and
rioting around under these walls, first
and last; plenty of fists and sticks and
stones. It's big, isn't it? Big as half
a block, and things look so much bigger
here than they do at home. They slide
a roof up slanting and cock it full of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
little crooked windows, and you feel as
if you must tip over backward to take
in the top. I vow, I don't just see how
it's done; but&mdash;oh, here's where we
go in. This dark, damp little stone-paved
alley is the celebrated 'Portail
des Libraires,' so called because those
arcades used to be full of book-stalls.
We go along on the cobble-stones,ont
throw ourselves hard against this little
swinging door; it creaks, it yields, we
enter&mdash;hush!</p>

<p>"Great Scott, isn't it big, and <i>isn't</i>
it damp? Will you look up in that roof?
I feel solemn in spite of myself; but,
then, feeling solemn is no use: what we
want to do is to find some one to open
those big iron gates, for the most of
what is to see is in back there. Edna,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
you ask that man how we can get hold
of some other man. Well, what did he
say? Said to ask the Swiss, did he?
What does he mean by that? Is it a
joke, or can't they trust a Frenchman
with their old relics? I've been told
that in Japanese banks they always have
to have a Chinaman to handle the
money, and maybe it's equally the
thing in a French cathedral to have a
Swiss look after the relics. But the
guide-book never said a word about a
Swiss: it said '<i>fee</i>,' and I've got my
pocket full of them.</p>

<p>"Well, where can we get a Swiss?
I should think he'd be more handy
than he appears to be. There's another
man looking for him, too. He&mdash;Great
Scott! if it isn't&mdash;no, that is impossible.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
Yes, it is!</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon, sir, but is your
name Porter? Yes? Robert Porter&mdash;Bobby
Porter that went to the Washington
School? Bob, do you remember
me? Well, of all the larks!</p>

<p>"Girls, this man and I went to school
side by side for eight years, and he's the
finest&mdash;my nieces, Bob. That's Edna
and this is Yvonne, and&mdash;you don't say
he's your son? Didn't know you
ever married. Oh, I'll take your word
for it, of course; but, I say, Bob, you've
got to come and dine with us to-night.
You must; I won't have it any other
way. You and I'll have to just sit
down and overhaul all our old memories
together. Do you remember&mdash;but
how do you come to be in Europe, anyhow;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
and what liner did you line up
on? We had a beastly trip,&mdash;only came
from Havre last night,&mdash;and, by the
way, how in thunder can we get hold
of the man who opens these iron gates?
Everything in the place is back there.</p>

<p>"Is that a Swiss&mdash;that splendid circus-chariot
driver? Give you my word,
I thought he was a cardinal! How
much of a tip is that much gold lace
going to look forward to getting? I
wish he was plainer, somehow. I'll
tell you, Bob; you pay, and I'll settle
up later. I certainly am glad to see the
gates open; I felt more like a serpent
shut out of paradise than I ever expected
to feel in all my life.</p>

<p>"Well, now we begin. Who's buried
here? Henry II of England, eh?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
I can't read Latin, so Henry's virtues
and dates are all one to me. Which
Henry was he, anyhow&mdash;the one with
six wives or the one who never shed a
smile? Either way, let's move on.</p>

<p>"What comes next?
Richard-C&#339;ur-de-Lion&mdash;petrified, eh? Oh,
only a statue of him; that's less interesting.
I thought at last I was looking at Richard
when he was himself again. What
is our Swiss friend hissing about? Heart
buried underneath? Whose heart?&mdash;Richard's?
Ask if it's his bona fide
heart or only a death-mask of it? Strikes
me as a pretty big statue to put up to
a heart, don't you think, Bob? But
come on; I want to be looking at something
else.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span></p>
</div>

<p>"So this is the tomb of the husband<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
of Diana of Poitiers? I didn't know
she ever had a husband&mdash;thought she
only had a king. I've never been
brought up to think of Diana of Poitiers
mourning a husband. But maybe she
did, maybe she did. They say you must
check your common sense at the hotel
when you set out to inspect Europe, and
I believe it&mdash;I believe it. It's a nice
tomb, and if they kneel and mourn in a
gown with a train, she certainly is doing
it up brown. However, let's go on.</p>

<p>"Two cardinals of Amboise kind of
going in procession on their knees over
their own dead bodies&mdash;or maybe it's
only hearts again. Well, Bob, the Reformation
was a great thing, after all,
wasn't it? Must have felt fine to
straighten up for a while. Stop a bit;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
the guide-book said there was something
to examine about these two&mdash;wait till I
find the place. Oh, well, never mind;
I dare say a guide-book's very handy,
but I move we quit this damp old hole,
anyway. I wouldn't bother to come
again. That's a sad thing about life,
Bob; as soon as you get in front of anything
and get a square look at it, you're
ready to move on&mdash;at least I am.</p>

<p>"What's he saying? Well, ask him
again. Whose grave? Well, ask him
again. Rollo's! What, Rollo that was
'At Work' and 'At Play' and at everything
else when we were kids? Another?
What other? Well, ask him.
Rollo the Norman? I don't see anything
very remarkable in a Norman being buried
in Normandy, do you, Bob? When<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
did he die? Well, <i>ask</i> him. What are
we paying him for, anyway? Died about
900, eh! And this church wasn't built
till four hundred years later. Where did
he spend the time while he was waiting
to be buried? Well, ask him. I declare,
if I could talk French, I bet I'd know
something about things. You are the
<i>dumbest</i> lot! Here's Rollo lying around
loose for as long as we've had America
with us, and no one takes any interest in
where. Is that the tomb he finally got
into? Clever idea to have it so dark no
one can see it, after all. I suppose he
thinks we'll be impressed, but I ain't.
I don't believe Rollo's in there, anyhow.</p>

<p>"Come on; I'm tired of this old
church. I move that we go out and
look at the place where they burned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
Joan of Arc, or something else that is
bright and cheerful. What's he saying?
No, I don't want to see any treasury;
I've done enough church-going for
one week-day. Give him his money,
Bob, and let's get out. You tell us
where to go next; you must know everything,
if you were here all day yesterday.
I want to see that double-faced
clock and those carvings of the Field of
the Cloth of Gold. They're all over
in the same direction.</p>

<p>"Good to be out in the air, eh? I
vow, I never was great on churches.
What boat did you come over on? Did
it roll? Ours rolled and pitched, too.
I never saw such a rolling. I tell you,
Bob, the man will make a fortune who
invents a level liner. I used to try and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
figure on how to hang the passenger department
in an open square, so it could
swing free,&mdash;do you get the idea?&mdash;but
I don't know as it could be managed.
I was trying to work it out one morning,
and I came up against the wash-stand
so sudden that I thought I was cut
in two; the next second I went backward
so quick that the edge of the berth
nearly amputated my legs; and then the
whole craft arose on such a swell that I
swallowed half my tooth-brush. You
may laugh, Bob, but I'm not telling
this to be funny; I'm telling it for a
fact. I had to have the steward in to
put the washing-apparatus to rights, and
I asked him what in thunder was up
outside. He was standing at an angle
of forty-five degrees, looking up at me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
where I sat in the lower berth, and he
said, 'If the wind shifts, we're very
likely to have it rough.' Just then he
took on an angle of ninety-five degrees,
and my trunk slid out on his feet so
quick he had to hop. I said: 'Have it
<i>rough</i>, eh? Well, I'm glad to know, so
that I can take advantage of this calm
spell.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span></p>
</div>

<p>"So that's the clock! Well, it's a
big one, surely&mdash;almost as wide as the
street, although candor compels us to
own that the street is about the narrowest
ever. All right, I'm done; a clock
is a clock, and one look in its face always
tells me all I want to know. Come on;
we can't stand dilly-dallying if we're to
get through Rouen to-day, and I must
say I consider a day to a town as quite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
enough in Europe. I know, when I
was young and traveled for wholesale
shoes, I used often and often to do three
towns a day and never turn a hair. I
tell you, Bob, when I was&mdash;</p>

<p>"Is that the fountain? Hold on; we
want to see that! The guide-book has
it in italics. I don't see anything to
underline, though; looks foreign to me.
Come on; we've got to be getting somewhere,
or I shall feel I was a fool to stop
off at Rouen. Not that I'm not glad
to have met you again, Bob; but that
could have happened anywhere else just
as well, you know. When did you come
over? Last year! Great Scott, what are
you staying so long for? I bet I get
enough in six weeks; I feel as if I'd got
pretty close to enough now. Not that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
time ever hangs heavy on my hands, you
know. No, not by a long shot. I'm
the kind of man that can always amuse
himself. Give me a fair show,&mdash;off a
ship, of course,&mdash;and I'll defy any one
to get on better. Take the day we
landed, for instance, there in Havre,&mdash;rainy,
not a thing to do, and every one
else off for Paris. You might have
looked for me to be a little disgusted,
naturally; but not a bit of it. The day
went like the wind. We landed at noon,
I slept all the afternoon, and in the
evening I took a bath. I tell you, Bob,
a fellow with brains can get on anywhere.
I never know what it is to feel
bored.</p>

<p>"What's our Goddess of Liberty doing
up there? What's that Indian beadwork<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
around her feet for? Who? You
don't mean to tell me that's Joan of
Arc? Well, all I can say is, I never imagined
her like that. But what are the
beads? French funeral wreaths! Great
Scott! do they keep Charlemagne
wreathed, too, or is five hundred years
the bead-wreath limit? Pretty idea, to
put up a fountain where they burnt
her&mdash;keep her memory damp at all
events, eh? What's the moral of her
train turning into a dolphin? Just to
bring the mind gradually down to the
level of the fact that it is a fountain, after
all, I suppose.</p>

<p>"She wasn't burnt here, anyhow, the
book said. The book said she was
burnt farther over. Smart people here&mdash;have
two places where she was burnt,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
so people must trot through the whole
market if they try to be conscientious.
Look at that woman, with her bouquet
of live chickens&mdash;novel effect in chickens,
eh, Bob? Strikes me it was an enterprising
idea to burn Joan in the market,
anyhow&mdash;good business for the
market. Folks come to see the statue,
and incidentally buy some peanuts.</p>

<p>"Well, where can we go now? I say
to set out and have a look at the tower
where she was imprisoned. Pulled
down! It isn't, either; it's starred in
the book. What's that? This tower
named for her, and hers pulled down!
Well, there's French honor for you
again. What do you think of Sibbilly
now, Edna? I don't want to see the
tower if it ain't the real one. I want<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
to see the bas-reliefs of the Field of the
Cloth of Gold, and then I want to go
back to the hotel to lunch. I tell you,
this sight-seeing is a great appetizer.
The more old ruins and burnings I look
over, the hungrier I get.</p>

<p>"Is this the place? Makes me think
of a sort of glorified gate to a woodyard.
What is it, now? Well, ask somebody!
A bank, eh? Are those the famous
bas-reliefs? Those! Them! Well, well,
I must say the touring public is easy
game. They're all worn off. What's
the tin overhead for? To keep the rain
from damaging them, eh? Pretty bit of
sarcasm, eh, Bob? Great pity they
didn't think to put it four or five hundred
years sooner. I don't see a man
with a head or a horse with a leg from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
here. It lacks character, to my idea.
Let's go home. Come on. I've racked
around Rouen all I care to for one
day."</p><br>

<p class="rthead"><i>Rouen.</i></p>

<p><span class="dropcap">D</span><span class="smcap">earest Mama</span>: It is
midnight, and I must tell
you the most astonishing
piece of news. We came here with
Uncle last night, and all this morning
we were out with him. When we came
home and unlocked our room we found
<i>Lee</i> sitting by the window. But he
doesn't want Uncle to know. It was
fortunate that Uncle's room is across the
hall, for I screamed. We couldn't see
how he got in, but he says that he has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
bent a buttonhook so that he can travel
all over Europe. It seems he never
meant to go to Russia at all; but he
doesn't want Uncle to know. He says
he thinks Russia is a good place for Uncle
to imagine him in. We had such
fun! We told him all about the voyage
and all about Uncle. He says M. Sibilet's
mother <i>is</i> his wife&mdash;he married her
for money. He says he's a painter.
Lee is really going yachting, but he
doesn't want Uncle to know. He isn't
going for a while, though; and he
doesn't want Uncle to know that,
either. While we were talking, Uncle
rapped, and Lee had to get into the
wardrobe while Uncle came in and read
us a lecture. When we were in the
cathedral to-day he found a man he used<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
to know in school, and he was utterly
overjoyed until he saw that the man had
a son; and then, of course, he was worried
over the son. So he came in to-night
to tell us that it he discovered any
skylarking, he should at once give up a
friendship which had always meant
more to him than we young things could
possibly imagine. He said we must
understand that he'd have no sort of
foolishness going on, and at that the
wardrobe creaked so awfully that Edna
had a fit of coughing, and I didn't know
what I should have if he kept on. He
didn't go until it was high lunch-time,
and I was afraid Lee would have to stay
in the wardrobe until he smothered.
When Uncle was gone, Edna asked Lee
how under the sun he kept still, and he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
said he nearly died, because so many
hooks hooked into his coat and he had
nothing to perch on except shoe-trees.
I do think Lee is so clever. I wish
Uncle thought so, too. He went to
his room, and we lunched with Uncle,
Mr. Porter, and Mr. Porter, Jr.; and
afterward we visited the church of the
Bon-Secours and the monument to
Jeanne d'Arc. She stands on top, her
hands manacled, with her big, frightened
eyes staring sadly and steadily out
over the town where she met death.
Uncle admired her so much that he
tripped on one of the sheep that are
carved on the steps, and after that he
didn't admire anything or anybody.
We got back about five, and Lee came
in for a visit of an hour. Lee says he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
had a fine voyage. It stormed, and he
says he never was battened down with
such a lively lot of people. Uncle came
in twice while he was there, but Lee
has the wardrobe by heart now, and
doesn't take a second. He says the men
he's going yachting with are great sport,
and he expects to have the time of his
life. I do wish Uncle liked Lee, so that
he could go around with us these days;
he would be so much fun.</p>

<p>We are going to Jumièges to-morrow,
Uncle says. Lee says he must
take the early train for Havre. He's
just been in to say good-by. He brought
a cherry-tart and his shoe-horn, and we
had ours, and so we had no trouble at
all in eating it.</p>

<p>It has raised my spirits lots, seeing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
Lee. It seemed so terrible for him to
go off to Russia like that. Uncle spoke
of it yesterday. He said he was glad
to have one worry off his mind and safe

<p><span class="dropcap">D</span><span class="smcap">ear Mama</span>: Lee is gone.
I do wish he could have
stayed longer, but he thought
it was risky. Uncle John was sure
he smelt cigarette smoke in my room,
and although it wasn't true at all,
Edna cried and said the wardrobe
was getting on her nerves, and Lee said
he reckoned he'd take his button-hook
and move on. We had an awful time
bidding him good-by, for Uncle came
in three times, and the second time he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
had lost his umbrella and thought it
must be in our wardrobe. I never was
so frightened in all my life; for, you
know, if Uncle had been hunting for
his umbrella and had found Lee, he
wouldn't have liked it at all. Edna
volunteered to look in the wardrobe,
and I know I must have looked queer,
for Uncle asked if I'd taken cold.
You know how much I think of Lee,
but I couldn't help being relieved when
he was gone. It is such a responsibility
to have a man in your wardrobe
so much of the time. He said that I
must try to steer Uncle toward Brittany,
because he'll be yachting all
around there. He says I must mark
places in the Baedeker with strips of
paper. He says that's a fine way to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
make any one go anywhere, and that if
Edna and I will talk Italy and mark
Brittany, Uncle is almost sure to wind
up in the Isle of Jersey. Lee says he
wishes he'd been kinder to Uncle in
America, and then he'd like him better
in Europe. He's afraid Uncle will
never forgive him for taking him bobbing
that time and dumping him off in
the snow. It was too bad.</p>

<p>We went to Jumièges to-day. Uncle
found it in the guide-book, and we took
an eleven-o'clock train. Mr. Porter and
his son were late, and just had time to
get into the rear third-class coach.
Uncle was much distressed until we
came to Yainville, where the train
stopped, and they got out. Uncle
wanted them to get in with us, and he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
talked so forcibly on the subject that
the train nearly started again before Mr.
Porter could make him understand that
Yainville is where you get off for Jumièges.</p>

<p>I do wish it wasn't so hard to turn
Uncle's ideas another way when he's
got them all wrong.</p>

<p>Yainville has a red-brick depot on
the edge of a pleasant, rolling prairie,
but there is a little green omnibus to
hyphenate it with Jumièges. We were
a very tight fit inside, for of course we
could only sit in Uncle's lap, and he
didn't suggest it, so I had to hold
Edna; and Mr. Porter and his son
knew Uncle well enough not to suggest
taking her. I thought that we
should never get there; and it was so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
tantalizing, for the country became
beautiful, and we could only see it in
little triangular bits between shoulders
and hats. Young Mr. Porter wanted
to get out and walk, but Uncle said,
"Young man, when you are as old as
I am, you will know as much as I do,"
so he gave up the idea. I do believe
we were cooped up for a solid hour before
we finally rolled down a little bit
of a hill into a little bit of a village,
and climbed stiffly out into the open
air.</p>

<p>We all had to cry out with wonder
and admiration then, it was really
so wonderful. On one side were the
hills, with the Seine winding off toward
Paris; and on the other side was the
wood, with the ragged ruins of the abbey-church<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
walls towering up out of the
loftiest foliage. Uncle thought we had
better go and see all there was to be
seen directly, so we walked off down
the little road with a funny feeling of
being partly present and partly past, but
very well content.</p>

<p>The story goes that one of the ancient
French kings took two young princes
of a rival house, crippled them, put
them on a boat, and set them afloat at
Paris. They drifted down the current
as far as this spot, and here they were
rescued. They founded a monastery
in gratitude, and their tomb was in the
church, which is now in ruins. Later
we saw the stone, with their effigies, in
the little museum by the gate. They
were called "Les Deux Enervés," in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
reference to their mutilation. Uncle
thought the word meant "nervous,"
and we heard him say to Mr. Porter,
"Well, who wouldn't have been, under
the circumstances?" The whole of
the abbey is now the private property of
a lady who lives in a nice house up over
back beyond somewhere. She built the
lodge, and also a little museum for relics
from the ruins, and has stopped the
wholesale carrying off of stones from
the beautiful remnants of what must
have once been a truly superb monument.
I am sure I shall never in all
my life see anything more grand or
impressive than the building as it is to-day.
It is much the same plan as the
cathedral at Rouen, only that that has
been preserved, and this has been long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
abandoned. It is so curious to think of
the choir which we saw yesterday, with
its chapels and stained glass, and then
to compare it with this roofless and windowless
one, out of the tops of the walls
of which fir-trees&mdash;big ones&mdash;are growing.
You don't know what a strange
sensation it is to see trees growing out
of the tops of ruined walls the foundations
of which were laid by Charlemagne's
relatives. Edna and I felt very
solemn, and Uncle was quiet ever so
long, and then only said, "I vow!" The
grass is growing in the nave and transept,
and the big carved pediments stick
up through the turf here and there, with
moss and lichen clinging to the shadowy
sides. The rows of pillars are pretty
even, and the set of big arches above are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
mostly all there still. There were a
third and a fourth gallery above, and
although they are fallen away in places,
still you can see exactly how it used to
be. When you look away up to the
fourth tier of columns, the main walls
of the nave are still soaring higher yet;
and when you follow the sky-line of
their vastness, you see the two mighty
towers rising, rising, straight up toward
heaven, with the rooks whirling and
circling about them and screaming in
the oddest, most awfully mournful manner.
I'm sure I shall never feel the same
way again, not even if I live to be a
thousand years old myself. I felt overcome;
I felt a way that I never felt
before. I don't know what I felt.</p>

<p>Uncle was delighted; he sighed with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
satisfaction. "This is the real thing,"
he said to Mr. Porter; "I like this.
You can see that there's been no tampering
with <i>this</i> ruin." Mr. Porter
looked up at the sky above and said:
"I should say that there had been considerable
tampering with this ruin. I
will take my oath that the whole of the
little town yonder was built with the
stone taken from these walls and those
of the monastery buildings."</p>

</div>

<p>Uncle is getting very nervous over
Mr. Porter, Jr., because he walks around
with Edna so much; so we were not
allowed out of his sight during the visit,
and didn't explore half as much as we
wanted to. The little museum was
really very interesting, and had the
tombstone of one of Joan of Arc's
judges. I feel very sorry for Joan's poor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
judges. They had to do as they were
bid, and have been execrated for it ever
since.</p>

<p>We came home late in the afternoon,
and Mr. Porter found a telegram calling
him to Brussels on business, so he and
his son said good-by hurriedly and took
a half-past-six train. Uncle said at dinner
that it was a strange thing to see
how, after forty-five years of seeing the
world, a man could still be the same as
when one had to do all his sums for him
at school. We absorbed this luminous
proposition in silence, and then Uncle
looked severely at Edna and said that at
the rate that things were progressing he
wouldn't have been surprised to have
had a John Gilpin in the family any
day. We were struck dumb at this
threat or prophecy or whatever was intended,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
and went meekly to bed. Edna
had a letter from Lee and I had one
from Harry. Lee didn't dare write me
and Harry didn't dare write Edna because
of Uncle. But they each sent the
other their love.</p>

<p>Uncle wants to go to Gisors to-morrow.</p>

<p>P. S. I must add a line to tell you
that Mrs. Braytree and the four girls
have arrived. They saw Uncle on the
stairs coming up, and all came straight
to our room. They landed yesterday,
and had a real good passage, only Eunice
fell out of the berth and sprained her
wrist. She has it in a sling. They had
a hard time arranging about the dog, as
the hotel didn't want him in the rooms.
He is one of those dogs that look<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
scratchy and whiny at the first glance.
Mrs. Braytree has lost her keys, so she
sat with us while the hotel people got
a man to open her trunks. She says
she's in no hurry to unpack, for she had
so many bottles she's almost positive
one cork at least must have come out.
They entirely forgot to bring any hairpins
and suffered dreadfully on shipboard
on that account. They had trouble with
one of their port-holes too, and Mrs.
Braytree and Uncle are both going to
carry crowbars at sea hereafter.</p>

<p>They are going to stay here a week.
It's so nice to meet some one from
home!</p>

<br>


<p class="rthead"><i>Rouen.</i></p>


<p><span class="dropcap">"C</span><span class="smcap">ome on</span>, girls, this is quite an
expedition. I vow I shook a
little when Mrs. Braytree suggested
coming, too. Seven women to
one man would be too many for comfort
as a general thing; but your Uncle John
never shows the white feather, so I only
drew the line at the dog. Why the
devil five women want to travel with
one dog and eight trunks I can't see;
but if I was Mrs. Braytree, I'd probably
know more about it. Curious little
creature, the cross-eyed one, isn't she?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
And that Pauline&mdash;always wanting to
be somewhere else. I told her pretty
flatly at dinner that if she couldn't get
any more fun out of Rouen than by
wishing it was St. Augustine, she'd better
have stayed in New York. Anything
but these fault-finders.</p>

<p>"Well, ain't you ready? I've sent the
luggage along, and it seems to me that
we ought to be following its good example.
Lord knows, two days is enough
to waste in an old hole like Rouen; I
was wondering last night what we ever
came for. I never was so cold anywhere
in my life, and sleeping on a slope with a
pillow on your feet isn't my idea of comfort
at night, anyhow. I don't understand
the moral of the scheme, and the
pillow keeps sliding, and I keep swearing,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
all night long. Also, I can't learn
to appreciate the joy of standing on a
piece of oil-cloth to wash. I must say
that one needs to wear an overcoat and
ear-muffs to wash here, anyhow. I was
dancing under the bell-rope and ringing
for hot water a good half-hour this
morning. I'm going to write and have
the asterisk subtracted from this hotel.</p>

<p>"Well, come on, if you're ready.
Whose umbrella is that getting left by
the door? Mine? I vow, I didn't remember
putting it down. But no one
can think of everything. Edna, is this
soap yours? No? Well, I just asked. I
seem to have left mine somewhere, and
it's live and learn. Come on! come on!</p>

<p>"Good morning,
Mrs. Braytree&mdash;Eunice&mdash;Emma&mdash;Pauline&mdash;Augusta.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
I reckon we'd better be hustling along
pretty promptly. The train doesn't go
until five minutes after the time, if we
don't hurry. It's truly a pleasure having
you join us, Mrs. Braytree. A little
excursion like this makes such a pleasant
break in the routine of sight-seeing, I
think, and these quaint old&mdash;there, all
get out now, I have the money. I'll
take the tickets; we're all full-fare,
aren't we? Or&mdash;how old is the little
cross-eyed one? I <i>beg</i> your pardon, Mrs.
Braytree, but I had to know in a hurry.</p>

<p>"There, come on! come on! Squeeze
through. Se&mdash;ven women and one man.
Hurry! we want a compartment, here&mdash;no,
there. Run, Edna, and get ahead
of that old lady; here's two umbrellas
to throw crossways, and then you can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
tell her there's no room, and the law
will uphold you. You look surprised,
Mrs. Braytree, but I learned that little
trick coming from Havre. I tell you,
by the time I get to Paris I'll be on to
every kind of game going. I learn fast&mdash;take
to Europe as a duck takes to
water, so to speak.</p>

<p>"Well, we're off for Gisors. Great
pleasure to have you with us, Mrs. Braytree;
no more work to steer seven&mdash;Good
Lord! there aren't but six here!
Who isn't here? Edna's gone! What
is it, Yvonne? I sent her ahead, did I?
Oh, so I did, so I did. And of course
she is waiting for us. Poor child! I
hope she's not worried. As soon as we
get out of the tunnel I'll hang out of
the window and holler to her. Very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
convenient method of talking to your
friends aboard, Mrs. Braytree; only I
should think a good many would lose
their heads as a consequence. However,
as the majority of the heads would be
foreigners', I don't suppose it would
matter much in the long run.</p>

<p>"Speaking of Gisors, Mrs. Braytree,
it's really a very interesting place&mdash;according
to the guide-book. As far as I'm
personally concerned, I'd be willing
to take the time to go there to learn
how to pronounce it. The workings of
the mind which laid out the way to speak
French don't at all jibe with the workings
of the mind which laid out the way
to spell it&mdash;not according to my way of
thinking. There's that place which
we've just left, for instance,&mdash;'Ruin'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
as plain as the nose on your&mdash;on anybody's
face,&mdash;and its own inhabitants
can't see it&mdash;pronounce the R in a way
that I should think would make their
tongues feel furry, and then end up as if,
on second thought, they wouldn't end
at all.</p>

<p>"Yvonne, I wish you'd hang out and
see if you see any of Edna hanging out.
I declare, this is a very trying situation
to be in. You don't know what a trip
I had, Mrs. Braytree, trying to keep track
of these girls; and since we landed&mdash;well,
I just had to call a halt in Havre
and come off alone. Curious place,
Havre, don't you think? See any one
you knew there? We&mdash;who did
you say? Why, that can't be, he's in
Russia. Yvonne, didn't that young<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
reprobate write you he was going to
Russia? Yes, I thought so. Well,
Mrs. Braytree says she saw him in Havre.
Good joke his not knowing we were in
Rouen; he'd have been down there in
a jiffy, I'll bet anything. But your
Uncle John is a rather tough customer
to handle, and I expect that young man
knows the fact, and so thought it best to
give Rouen a wide berth. Not that I
have anything in particular against young
Reynolds, only I don't consider that any
girl could be happy with him. And
it's foolish to have a man around unless
you can make him happy&mdash;I mean unless
he can make you happy. My wife was
very happy up to the time she developed
melancholia&mdash;a sad disease, Mrs. Braytree.
Yvonne, I wish you'd hang out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
and see if you can see anything of
Edna.</p>

<p>"I presume this is as good a time as
we'll have to study up a little on Gisors.
It seems to have been the capital of the
Vexin. I shouldn't be surprised if
'vex' and 'vexing' both come from that
country, for the guide-book gives it as
always in hot water. The French and
English were both up against it most of
the time, and it was vexin' with a
vengeance. It says here that the old city
walls are still standing and that Henry
II built the castle. Isn't he the one we
peeked around in Rouen? Yes, I thought
so. It says that there's very little
left of the castle, though. I must say
I'm always glad when I read that there's
not much left of anything; it gives me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
a quiet, rested sort of feeling."</p><br>

<p>"Well, here we get out. I'll swing
down first. If French trains were
American, they'd have trapezes or elevators
to&mdash;get&mdash;out&mdash;by. Here, give
me your hand, Yvonne&mdash;oh, there's
Edna. Well, I vow, who has she got&mdash;if
it isn't&mdash;Yvonne, isn't that that
young man&mdash;how d'ye do, Edgar?
Delighted to see you again. Our friend,
Mrs. Braytree, and all the others are her
daughters. Come, Edna; you come
with me while I check this trunk.
Where in thunder did you get that fellow
from? How does he come to be in
Rouen? Did you know he was in Rouen?
Did you see him while he was there?
I declare, I never will travel with any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
women again unless I am married to
them. This is awful. Don't you know
I'm responsible for you two girls? And
I send you ahead to get a compartment,
and you find Edgar&mdash;it makes
me want to swear. Say, was there
any one else with you? Worse and
worse. I was afraid there was something
wrong when we kept hanging
out and you never hung out at all.
Well, we'll have to go back and gather
them all up. Yes, I'll be polite to him;
but, Edna, I hope you understand distinctly
that a man like that could never
make any woman&mdash;</p>

<p>"Yes, Mrs. Braytree, here we are
again; and now we'll all proceed over
Gisors. Pretty place, don't you think?
Picturesque. Did you ever see so many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
canals&mdash;or smell so many?&mdash;and the little
cottages out of another century? Packed
roofs&mdash;green trees&mdash;well-sweeps&mdash;I like
this; I'm glad I had the sense to come
here. Edgar, will you oblige me by
carrying that cane so that child doesn't
come within an ace of catching her
mouth on it every other second? I declare,
Mrs. Braytree, I wish we hadn't
run on to that young man. Of course
he's a nice fellow and all that, but young
men are a great trial when you have
two&mdash;</p>

<p>"Let's turn down here. Most of the
streets seem to be canal tow-paths. I
vow, this <i>is</i> pretty. I could settle down
in a place like this and live till I died.
What do you suppose the people here
do to amuse themselves, anyhow? From<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
the way they look at us with their
mouths open I should imagine that we
were regarded in the light of a great
event. And if that's the case, they must
be pretty hard up for sport. Oh, well,
I presume it's enough for them to paddle
about on the green waters and stir up
the miasma&mdash;as much sense as foreigners
have.</p>

<p>"And so these are the walls&mdash;ramparts,
I mean. Well, they're fairly
high. Wonder how high they are,
anyhow? Edgar, will you do me the
courtesy not to be pointing to the left
with that cane of yours when I turn
suddenly to the right again? I beg your
pardon for seeming heated, Mrs. Braytree;
but he really&mdash;</p>

<p>"Let's find a gate and go in; seems<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
to be a park inside. I should think there
<i>was</i> 'little left to be seen of the castle!'
I don't see anything at all of it. Maybe
they took it down and built the walls
higher just to fool tourists. Well, I
didn't come to Gisors to caper about in
a park; let's go out and look at the
church&mdash;the guide-book says the church
is worth seeing. I think there's something
very touching about guide-book
enthusiasm: it keeps up so consistently
right through to the end. I feel as if
my own enthusiasm was most run
through now. I don't know how Paris
will affect me. Edgar, if I trip on that
cane you'll have to pay my doctor's bill.
What makes you handle it as you do,
anyway? I like to see a cane light and
alert&mdash;not one that drags through the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
world in the style of yours. To judge
from your cane, I should say you hadn't
been in bed before three for a month.
I have to speak sharply to that fellow,
Mrs. Braytree; he is about as wooden-headed
as they make. Came across the
ocean with us, and pestered the life out
of me. You don't know what an ocean
voyage is with two attractive girls&mdash;I
<i>beg</i> your pardon; I forgot your four.
Dear me! we were speaking of&mdash;yes&mdash;of
Gisors, of course. I vow, I'm disappointed
in it as a whole. I wish we'd
gone to Les Andelys instead. Les
Andelys is marked with an asterisk in the
guide-book, and there's a castle there
built by C&#339;ur-de-Lion. By the way,
Mrs. Braytree, the C&#339;ur-de-Lion <i>itself</i>
is buried in Rouen. Did you know that?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
Nice joke, eh? But, dear, dear, if there's
no castle here when we get here, perhaps
there'd be none there when we got
there. I'm beginning to look upon
Europe as a confidence-game; I&mdash;</p>

<p>"Well is <i>that</i> the castle! Great Scott!
but it must have been big. It's big yet,
and the book said there was very little
left to see. I'm beginning to lose faith
in that book. Picturesque idea, having
the park hide the ruins till you come right
smash on to them. Clever people, the
French; make everything put the best
foot foremost. Fine old round tower;
nice tumble-down guard-chamber! I
like this. Let's go around the other
side. Great place, eh? Worth a trip to
see. Edgar, let me have your cane to
point with. There, do you see that old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
staircase? Looks Roman to me; what
do you think? I tell you, a man could
write an historical novel out of old ruins
if he prowled long enough. Come on
now; let's meander on down town and
look at the church. As soon as I look
at anything, I'm always ready to look
at something else. Let's go out on this
side and go back to town the other way.
Then we'll look at the church, and then
we'll put you and Edgar on the train
for Rouen, Mrs. Braytree. What did
you say, Yvonne? He isn't going to
Rouen? Where is he going? To Paris
with us! Well, well, well! all I can say
is, I do admire his nerve. I never in all
my life went where I wasn't asked, and
took a cane. Now don't you see why
no woman could be happy with a man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
like that? I never saw the beat. I tell
you frankly, Yvonne, I don't like his
ways and I don't like him. If you girls
had let him alone on the boat, he'd have
let us alone here. I declare, my day is
just about spoiled. Your mother has
trusted you girls to me, and I haven't
drawn a quiet breath since. I did take
a little comfort there in Rouen; but if
I'd known that Lee was in Havre,
I'd have been on thorns even there.</p>

<p>"Well, where is the church? Ask
some one. What did she say? Down
here? Down we go, then. Ah, I suppose
that's it under the sidewalk. Nice
commanding situation for a church, to
grade a street by its tower! Why don't
they put in the guide-book, 'Street
commands a fine view of the roof?'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
There isn't time to go inside unless
Mrs. Braytree wants to miss her train,
and we don't want her to do that.</p>

<p>"This is the street to the <i>gare</i>, and
we'll run right along. I expect we can
get something to eat there, and get that
1:30 train for Beauvais. There isn't
anything in Beauvais that would interest
you, Mrs. Braytree; but there's a church
there that I want to see. The guide-book
says that Mr. Ruskin says that the
roof has got a clear vertical fall that not
many rocks in the Alps can equal; I
don't just know what a clear vertical
fall may be, but if there's a church anywhere
near as high as an Alp, I don't
want to miss seeing it.</p>

<p>"There's the clock. You just have
time to get aboard comfortably. Don't<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
you want to go with them, Edgar?
Well, I thought maybe you might.
Good-by, good-by; delighted to have
met you. Good-by. Oh, yes, of course.
In Paris.</p>

<p>"There, they're gone, darn 'em!
Now let's get some lunch. Did you
ever see such a collection as those girls?
It must have been a bitter pill when,
after managing to assimilate the looks
of the three oldest, the little one appeared
with her eyes laid out bias. Come
in here; we can get something to eat
here, I don't care what; but I want
plenty. Don't lose your cane, Edgar;
life wouldn't be life to you without it,
I expect. I like these country hotel
entrances, through a carriage-house and
a duck-yard, fall over a cat, and come in.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
Tell her we want dinner for four, and
prompt. You put that in good forcible
French for me, Edgar, and I'll be grateful
to you till I die. Let's sit down.
Let's eat."</p>

<p>"Now, young people, I call this making
a day count. This is my idea of getting
about. Breakfast in Rouen, <a name="lunch" id="lunch"></a><a href="#luuch">lunch</a> in
Gisors, Beauvais for a sandwich, and
we'll dine in Paris.</p>

<p>"What time is it? Three o'clock.
Well, we want to head straight for that
cathedral. Seems as if it ought to show
most anywhere over a little, low town like
this, but I don't see it. Ask someone&mdash;ask
any one. Well, what did they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
say? Right across the square. Whose
statue is that in the middle? Joan of
Arc? Jeanne Hachette? Who was
Jeanne Hachette? Girl who captured
flag from Charles the Bold, eh? Is that
why they called him 'the Bold'? Sort
of sarcastic on his letting a girl carry off
his flag, I should consider. Well, when
did she live? Has she got her year under
her? 1492. Seventy years after Joan.
I shouldn't have thought she'd have inspired
other young women in this part
of the country to emulate her.</p>

<p>"Do we go up here? Ugh, how I
hate walking over cobble-stones! Clean;
of course they're clean. I didn't say
that I thought they were dirty. I said
I hated to walk on 'em.</p>
<p>"What's that chopped-off creation
before us? <i>Not</i> the cathedral? Well&mdash;I&mdash;vow!</p>

happen to it? And what <i>was</i> Mr. Ruskin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
thinking of when he compared it to
an Alp! I don't want to fall off of anywhere,
but I'd choose the roof of that
cathedral to start from any day in preference
to the lowest Alp they make.
'Clear vertical fall' eh? I wish I knew
what that meant.</p>

<p>"Well, let's go in. Where's the
door? That little, unpretentious one
looks feasible. Come on. Well, Edgar,
are you coming, too, or do you choose
to stay outside with your stick? I can't
help it, Edna; I feel irritated at his being
here at all, and then I'm naturally
disappointed over this church. I must
say the biggest thing about it is that
blank wall stopping up where they left
off. This is the kind of thing I've
come several thousand miles to look at,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
is it? Well, may as well go in, I
suppose.</p>

<p>"So this is in the inside! Fine lot of
carpets hung up to try and cover the deficiencies,
eh?&mdash;High roof,&mdash;funny sort
of shock you get whenever you look towards
the front. Sort of like turning
around and hitting your cane, eh,
Edgar? Girls, this cathedral was begun
in 1180, time of Henry II, and they
quit in 1555 while Bloody Mary was
abroad and never got to the front end
in the four hundred years. Well, well!
dear, dear!</p>

Did you ever see anything like that

couldn't make any points around him.
Just hooks right on to us, and stays
hooked. I declare, if I carried a cane

<p class="rthead"><i>Gare du Nord, Paris.</i></p>

<p>"So this is Paris! Now, Edgar, I
have one favor to ask of you&mdash;will you
kindly allow me to manage my own
affairs while you manage yours? I
know just what to do, and I'll take<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
Yvonne with me to do it. You can
take Edna up to the hotel. Looked
disappointed, didn't he? Counting on
endearing himself to me forever by his
able-bodied assistance, I'll wager; but
I don't want any young man minding
my business. Tell that blue blouse to
take these checks and look up five
trunks in a hurry. What did he say?
We haven't got to overhaul them again
here, have we? Well, I am&mdash;I certainly
just <i>am</i>. Have we got to hunt
'em up? Where? Well, ask him?
Round back of this crazy mob? Well,
tell him to go first. What's this
system of wildly speculating wheat-pits?
Baggage-counters, eh? And will you
look at the baggage! Talk about your
'clear vertical falls!' Those trunks on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>

top will soon know more than Ruskin
ever did.</p>

<p>"Where's our man gone? Yvonne,
do you know where that fellow went
to? Well, ask some one. Look out&mdash;that
baggage truck will be Juggernauting
right over you before you know
it. Now, where <i>is</i> the porter? I call
this a pretty state of affairs&mdash;porter,
valises, and trunk-checks all gone together.
I thought you were watching
him or I would have done so. Do you suppose
we ought to speak to a policeman?
I think we ought to. But will you look
at the trunk-unlocking that's going
on&mdash;good as a play&mdash;look how mad
that old lady is; hear her give it to him
in good English. Guess something got
broke in transit. Keep a sharp eye out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
for that porter, Yvonne. Here come
some more trunks, and more, and
more yet. I wonder if this is regular,
or if we've struck a rush. Where <i>is</i>
that porter? I think we ought to be
speaking to a policeman, don't you?
Here's a choice new invoice of a couple
of thousand more trunks; that fellow
will never be able to find ours, I know.
Supposing he has found them and gone
off with them already. Hey, look
at that lady jumping up and down!
She sees <i>her</i> trunk, I'll bet a dollar.
Well, I'd jump up and down if I could
see mine. Yvonne, I really think we
ought to speak to a policeman. Could
you give a description of the man? I
only remember that he wore a blue
blouse. Oh, yes; and he had 'Commissionaire'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
across the front of his cap.
Hello, here are nine trucks all at once,
just a few million more additions to
the turmoil. I tell you, we won't get
out of here to-night, I don't believe.
I vow, I wish I'd given the checks to
Edgar, as he suggested. I really think
we ought to be calling a policeman.
Here are fourteen trucks all loaded to
the gunwales, and two mass-meetings
and one convention of tourists all at
once. Yvonne, this is beginning to
look serious to me; I think that really
we ought to call&mdash;</p>

<br>



<p class="rthead"><i>Paris.</i></p>


<p><span class="dropcap">D</span><span class="smcap">earest Mama</span>: Well
we <i>are</i> arrived! It <i>is</i> Paris
at last! But I thought we
should surely die in transit. I don't
know what Uncle would have said if
he had known that Lee was in Rouen;
he was dreadfully upset over Mrs.
Braytree's telling him that she saw
Lee in Havre. He was very unreasonable,
and laid it up against Lee that
Mrs. Braytree saw him. Just as if Lee<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
could help it.</p>

<p>We had a pretty good time coming
down, only Mr. Edgar came up and
came down with us, and of course
Uncle did not like that. I think that
Mr. Edgar came up to come down with
me because we had a lovely time on
the steamer coming over together, but
Uncle hardly gave me a chance to speak
to him. Uncle seems just instinctively
to know whom Edna and I want to talk
to, and then won't let us. But of
course I'm not complaining, for it was
lovely of him to give us this trip, and
we're enjoying every minute.</p>

<p>We arrived last night, and the only
drawback is that Mrs. Clary isn't here.
She left a note, and M. Sibilet's wife <i>is</i>
his mother, and has a place out at Neuilly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
and they were invited there for
three days. She will be back to-morrow,
and she left word for us to go
straight to the Bon Marché and look at
the white suits; so we did so. We told
Uncle it was all right for us to go alone,
and he had just gotten his mail, so he
only said "Hum!" and we went. Just
as we were taking the cab, who should
we see but Mr. Chopstone. It was so
lovely to see him again, and he got into
the cab and went with us. We went
to the Bon Marché, but it wasn't much
fun with a man, so we came out after a
little, and he proposed taking the Subway
and going to the Trocadero. Just
then we met a man that Mr. Chopstone
knew, and he had red hair and eye-glasses.
Mr. Chopstone introduced him,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
and invited him to go along; but he
said it was no use, because it was the
wrong day and we couldn't get in
when we got there. By this time we
were down in the Subway, and Mr.
Chopstone suggested that we go to the
Bois, so as not to have to go back up
the stairs again. While we were talking,
the train came and went in a terrible
hurry, and we got aboard in between.
After we were off, we found that Mr.
Chopstone wasn't on. We didn't
know what to do, because, of course, it
was he that we knew, and not the red-haired
man. The red-haired man said
he would do whatever we pleased, and
Edna thought we had better get right
off; but I thought we ought to go right
on. We didn't know <i>what</i> to do, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
so we kept on to the Bois.</p>

<p>The Bois was just lovely&mdash;all automobiles
and babies; and who do you
think we met? Betty Burleigh. We
were so surprised, for I thought she was
in California for her lungs; but it seems
that she's been in Dresden for her music
all winter, and now she's here for her
clothes. She was with an elderly French
lady, and I don't think that the elderly
French lady liked to have her stop and
talk to us. I thought at first that perhaps
it wasn't proper on account of the
red-haired man, but in a second I saw
the real reason. Betty glanced around
and said, "Oh, Madame, où est Fakir?"
Whereupon the elderly French lady
looked absolutely terrified and tore
madly off. We had quite a long talk<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
before she came back with the most
awful little black dog, which they evidently
had <i>no</i> string to. She put him
down and began to look displeased
again, and Betty just glanced about and
said calmly, "Oh, Madame, où es
Fakir?" He had absolutely vanished
again, and the elderly French lady sort
of threw up her eyes and rushed wildly
away. The red-haired man said, "Why
don't you buy a chain for him?" Betty
shrugged the Frenchiest kind of a shrug
and said, "I don't have to chase him."
The red-haired man said, "I should
think she would buy the chain then!"
and Betty shrugged a much Frenchier
shrug, and said: "I wouldn't allow it.
While she is running after him I can
do as I please." The red-haired man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
laughed. Poor madame came panting
up with the creature just then, and
Betty said sweetly, "Laissez-lui courir,"
so she had to put him down; but I
could see that she meant to keep a
sharp eye on him. Betty wanted us all
to come to the Palais and lunch with
her; but of course we refused, because
you wouldn't have liked it, and, anyway,
we had to go back to Uncle. She
wanted the red-haired man to stay, anyhow,
and was quite put out when he
declined. Just then two men in an automobile
came up and asked her to go
and see the balloon ascension. They
didn't invite the elderly French lady,
and she protested about "comme il
faut"&mdash;but Betty said, "Où est Fakir?"
and, if you'll believe me, that little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
beast was gone again, and poor madame
dashed off in pursuit. Betty made short
work of bidding us good-by then, and
at once got into the automobile, and
was off.</p>

<p>We came slowly along back with the
red-haired man, and at the Arc de
Triomphe we ran into Mr. Chopstone.
It seems he went a station too far because
he met some people he knew in
the car behind us, and he says we must
all go to the Châtelet with him to-night
to make up. He said "Uncle, too,"
so we accepted. Then we took a cab
and came back to the hotel, where we
found our beloved relative with his feet
on the center-table, reading the Paris
"Herald." He looked over the top at
us and announced that he'd "done the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
Louvre." I think we must have looked
startled, for he went on to say at once that
he knew that it was something that had
got to be done, and that he shouldn't
enjoy, and so he had thought it best to go
at it the first thing on the first morning
and get it off his mind at once. He was
very pleased with himself, because he
says the "Baedeker" says that it takes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
two hours and a half to walk through,
and he was only gone from the hotel
two hours in all. Edna asked him if he
spent much time looking at the pictures,
and he said: "Young lady, if you'd ever
been in the place, you'd never ask that
question. Why, the whole thing is
lined with pictures. I bet I dream of
gilt frames for a week."</p>

<p>We had to go to lunch, and Uncle
doesn't like the food very much; he
says it strikes him as "flummery," and
he is really very much vexed over Mrs.
Clary's being at Neuilly. Edna is vexed
because Harry is there, too, and I'm
very much vexed indeed because she
thoughtlessly gave Uncle the letter at
lunch, and when he read about Monsieur
Sibilet's wife being his mother he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
more put out than ever. He said we
could look out for ourselves this afternoon,
as he had to go to the bank. Edna
suggested that we go to the Louvre, and
he said yes, that would be wise, because
then we would all be free to enjoy ourselves.
Uncle speaks of the Louvre
exactly as if it were the semiannual
siege at the dentist's. But he was kind
enough to offer to leave us there on his
way to the bank, and when we took
the cab, he arranged with the cabman
and the hotel-porter exactly what the
fare was to be, and held it in his hand
the whole way.</p>

<p>Edna and I were mighty glad to get
to the Louvre without Uncle, especially
with the way he feels to-day, and we
were wandering along in a speechless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>

sort of ecstacy when all of a sudden I
heard some one calling my name. I
whirled around, and if it wasn't Mrs.
Merrilegs, in a state of collapse on one
of the red-velvet benches. We went
to her, and she took hold of our hands
as if she'd been our long-lost mother
for years. She looked very white and
tired and almost ready to faint, and we
sat down on each side of her in real
sincere sympathy, and she held our
hands and told us how it was. It
seems that they left home the last of
last month, and they've been all through
the British Isles, Denmark, Holland,
and Belgium, and they are going to
finish Europe and be home the first of
next month. She could hardly speak
for tears. She says Mr. Merrilegs made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
out the itinerary before they sailed and
that they have lived up to it every day
except just one, when he ate some
lobster crossing the Irish Sea, and they
lost a day that night. She says they
drive a great deal, because they can
hardly walk any more, and that she
doesn't believe that there will be a
museum or palace in Europe that they
won't be able to say that they have
driven by when they go home. She
said they had come to the Louvre to
see what pictures they wanted for their
new house, and that they never meant
to take more than twenty minutes for
the selection, and that they had been
there an hour already. She felt badly
because the itinerary had them visit
Notre Dame, the Eiffel Tower as high<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
as the elevator goes, and Versailles this
afternoon. She said they wanted to
try and call on the American consul,
too, to ask about a masseur. She said
Mr. Merrilegs said he thought if they
could get hold of a good masseur and
keep him right with them that they
could manage to rub through to the
end.</p>

<p>Edna and I felt dreadfully sorry for
her; but there did not seem to be anything
to do except look sad, and we did
that as heartily as we knew how until
in a minute or two Mr. Merrilegs hove
in sight with a funny little Frenchman
dancing round and round him. Mr.
Merrilegs looked almost as exhausted as
his wife, and called Edna by my name
and me by hers. His wife asked him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
if he had ordered the pictures, and he
said: "No; I haven't any more time
to waste here. I've given Claretie the
paper with the sizes of the spaces
marked on it, and he's to go through
and measure till he finds a famous picture
to match each space." Mrs. Merrilegs
sort of nodded faintly and said:
"But we don't want any martyrs in the
dining-room, you know," and her husband
said, "Yes, yes, he understands;
and he says he'll find a Susanna to fit
your bath, too." Mrs. Merrilegs stood
up then with a very audible groan, and
they both shook hands with us in a way
that quite wrung our hearts. Then they
limped away with the little Frenchman
spinning gaily about them, and we went<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
on alone.</p>

<p>In the very next room we met Mr.
Chopstone. He was awfully glad to see
us, and said, with our permission, he'd
join us; but as he seemed joined anyway,
we didn't even dream of refusing.
He asked if we'd told Uncle about
the Châtelet, and then we remembered
that we had forgotten. He said he was
so glad, because he couldn't get any
seats except <i>baignoirs</i>, and they looked
queer, because no one can see you. He
asked if we would like to go to the opera
instead, and we were just discussing it
when we turned a corner and ran right
on to Betty Burleigh and the red-haired
man. His name is Potter, and, did you
ever! They looked so upset that it can't<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
have been an accident, their being together.
But how could they have arranged
it? If they didn't arrange it,
why did they look upset? Betty had
on a bright green cloth dress and a
violet hat, and the red-haired man
heightened the general effect so much
that we moved on as quickly as possible.
Mr. Chopstone said very roundly:
"You'd better fight shy of her, I
think," and Edna said dryly: "Of him,
too, don't you think?" I waited a
minute, and then I said it seemed droll
to think that if we were all English
we'd be pleased to call poor Betty a
typical American.</p>

<p>We came home when the Louvre
closed and found Uncle back with his
feet on the center-table. He had had a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
big fire built, for he said it gave him chills
to look at the nymph over his bed. He
had put in a true Merrilegian afternoon,
having been to the Palais de Justice,
Sainte-Chapelle, Notre Dame, and driven
by the Hôtel de Ville and around the
Opera House&mdash;"completely around."
He says there won't be a thing left for
him to look at by Monday. He says
if he was pressed for time he'd hire a
cab for one whole day and lump the
business; but that, seeing that we have
the time, it really doesn't seem necessary.</p>

<p>The mail came while we were talking,
and the most unfortunate thing
happened. To keep up the Russian idea,
Lee wrote two postals and sent them to
St. Petersburg to be mailed. Uncle saw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
the Russian stamps and knew Lee's
writing, and he asked me to kindly tell
him how Mrs. Braytree came to see a
man who was in Russia in Havre. Edna
said weakly that it must have been a
joke, and Uncle shook his watch and
held it to his ear that way he always
does when he's dangerous, and said he
was in no mood for any of Lee's jokes.
He looked very severely at me and said
that Lee was a scalawag, and that I
ought to be ashamed of myself for having
him around.</p>

<p>Mrs. Clary will be back to-morrow,
and we're very glad, for Uncle is
awful peppery and tartary, and says
"Hum!" when we least expect it.
Edna sent Mr. Chopstone a <i>petit-bleu</i>,
asking him please not to ask us to go<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
anywhere to-night. Mr. Edgar sent
me some violets, but I had time to give
them to the chambermaid before Uncle
came in. If I only get a chance, I shall ask
Mrs. Clary to declare that M. Sibilet's
mother <i>is</i> his wife, even if she knows
it's a lie. It doesn't seem possible that
Uncle could really care for Mrs. Clary;
but he's so cross if she talks to any one
else that I almost wonder if he doesn't.
Edna is all tired out, and says she will
cry if Uncle tells her again that any
man isn't the man to make any girl
happy. She says she likes men, and she
thinks that they all make her happy.
She wanted to go to the Châtelet in a
<i>baignoir</i>, and she was wild to go to the
opera in anything.</p>

<p>We talk Italy and mark Brittany every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
chance we get, but Uncle says "Hum!"
to Italy the same as he does to everything
else these days. I'm sure I don't
see what we'll do if he takes the rest of
Europe as hard as he does this much.
But of course I don't mean that we're
not having a lovely time, and we never
forget for a minute how kind he was to
bring us.</p><br>


<p class="rthead"><i>Next day.</i></p>


<p>Oh, it has been awful! How can I
write it all!</p>

<p>You see, Uncle has a little balcony,
and the sun came out, so he did, too,
this morning, on his little balcony.
And he saw Mrs. Clary being brought
back in an automobile by M. Sibilet and
two French officers. Of course Harry
was there, too, but that didn't mend<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
matters any. In looking over, Uncle's
glasses fell to the ground, and they were
his comfortable ones with the rubber
round the nose, and that part broke, too.
Edna was taking a bath, and I had to
stand the brunt of the whole. Uncle
told me not to dare to fancy for a minute
that he cared who Mrs. Clary went
about with; but he did wish for the
credit of America that she would steer
clear of men like Sibilet. He was much
put out over the French officers, too, and
said that if he was a French officer he'd
go and walk around Alsace until he came
to his senses. While he was talking he
knocked the water-pitcher over, and then
Edna was ready to dress; so he went
away while I sopped up the floor.</p>

<p>Mrs. Clary came in right afterward.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
She has had a splendid time, and she says
she doesn't care what relation the old
lady is so long as she can have them for
friends. She has had no end of fun since
she came from Havre, and she says it's
a shame about Uncle. She went to a
beautiful lawn-fête at a countess's, and
she says I mustn't worry over Lee and
Uncle. She rode horseback, too, and
drove with a coach, and she says Edna
must remember that Uncle is always peculiar
and doesn't mean half he says.
She went to two dinner-parties, and no
one would believe that she was Harry's
mother. She says I ought not to be exasperated
over anything, because nothing
in the world can be so exasperating as
having a son with a moustache when
you don't look thirty-five, and that she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
doesn't let <i>that</i> worry <i>her</i>. M. Sibilet
is going to give a dinner for her at the
Ritz, and she's going to get a lace dress
all in one piece, and she says it was she
who told Mr. Edgar that we were coming
from Rouen, and that Betty Burleigh
is considered very fast, and that it
won't take long for her to settle Uncle.
I'm sure I hope so with all my heart;
but I don't believe he'll like the idea
of the dinner-party much. Mrs. Clary
says Mme. Sibilet's château is a perfect
castle, and that one of the French officers
in the automobile was a duke. She
says we must be patient, and Uncle will
get used to the Continent, just as all
American men do. She says they never
take to it like women, though. The
other French officer was in the ministry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
once, and counts more than any duke.
Mrs. Clary is always so sweet and comforting,
and she is such a nice chaperon,
because she always has men enough herself
never to be spiteful.</p>

<p>Mr. Chopstone sent Edna back a
<i>petit-bleu</i> that he had the box at the opera,
and what should he do about it. Mrs.
Clary says for us to go. She says she'll
take care of Uncle, for she wants to
straighten out her accounts, and she can
just as well straighten him out at the
same time. She gave me a long letter
from Lee that he left with her, and she
told Edna to go and have a nice walk
with Harry, and she'd tell Uncle they
were both asleep in their rooms. I declare,
it's good to have her back. I
feel as if a mountain was lifted off me,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
and on to her. She says you never
dreamed of such fun as she's had out
there at Neuilly, and that it's quite absurd&mdash;my
worrying over little things
like Lee and Uncle.</p>

<p>She talked so much that I grew quite
light-hearted, and had early dinner and
went off to the&mdash;</p>

<p>I'll have to write the rest to-morrow.
A boy says Uncle wants to speak to me.</p><br>


<p class="rthead"><i>Next day.</i></p>

<p>I do believe Lee knows better how to
manage Uncle than all of us put together!</p>

<p>When Uncle sent for me, I saw right
off that Mrs. Clary hadn't gotten him
anywhere near all smoothed out. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
looked awfully vexed, and he told me
he was done with Paris and he was going
to clear out at once. He said he
knew that Edna and I wanted to go to
Italy, but, unfortunately, he couldn't
see it himself in that light. Then he
paused and said "Hum!" and I waited.
After a little he said that he'd happened
to run across two or three things
lately that had rather interested him in
Brittany, and how would I like to go
there. I was almost stunned at the success
of Lee's scheme, and I was so
happy that I suddenly felt as if I wanted
Mrs. Clary and Edna to be happy, too,
and I threw my arms right around his
neck and said: "Oh, <i>Uncle</i>, let's go off
together&mdash;just you and me&mdash;and have
a real good time together, all by ourselves.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
Will you?"</p>

<p>I must have done it <i>very</i> well, for
Uncle's face smoothed out at once, and
he told me that he'd been meaning to
give me Aunt Jane's watch ever since
she died, only that it needed a new
spring, and he never could remember to
take it to the jeweler's. His face clouded
some later, and he shook his head
and said he wished he felt more security
as to Mrs. Clary and Edna; but then
he crossed his legs the other way, and
said we only had one life to live, and
could I be ready to start by day after
to-morrow. I said that I was sure I
could, and he said "Hum!" very pleasantly,
and I went to my own room and
told Mrs. Clary. She was so pleased;
she says I am a saint, and that it's too<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
bad for me to miss the dinner. She is
going to wear her pink pearls, and she
says that she will try to telegraph Lee.</p>

<p>I will confess that my heart sinks a
little bit from time to time when I
think of trying to bear Uncle all alone
for I don't know how long; but I have
great faith in Lee, and I know that
he'll be somewhere along the coast,
and that will be a comfort.</p>

<p>Uncle has been out and bought a
Gaelic grammar and the history of the
Siege of La Rochelle, for he says he
wants to have some intelligent conception
of what he sees. He wants me to
learn the grammar, and he says, where
he sees to everything, he should think
I could do a little trifle like that for
him once in a while. When he put it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
that way, I thought I must try; but,
oh, heavens! you ought to see that
grammar!</p>

<p>I will write again as soon as I can.
Harry is going to take us all to the
Café aux Fleurs for tea.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;">
<h2><a name="VII" id="VII"></a>VII</h2><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
<br>

<p><span class="dropcap">M</span><span class="smcap">y Dearest Mama</span>: We
are <i>en route</i>! We left Paris
at the cheerful hour of 7
<span class="smcap">a.m.</span> yesterday morning. No one was
up, and there was another train at half-past
nine, but Uncle said that, considering
the work that lay before us, we had
better not begin by dawdling. I do
think there is a happy medium between
rising at five and "dawdling," but of
course I didn't tell him so.</p>

<p>Edna sat up in bed and kissed me
good-by. She and Mrs. Clary looked
upon me as a cross between the saver of
the situation, and a burnt offering on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
Uncle's altar; but they were all happy,
and I didn't care&mdash;much.</p>

<p>Uncle mapped out the route, and, as
a result, we got down at Chartres about
half-past nine. He put the baggage in
<i>consigne</i>, and then looked about with the
air of a charger who sniffs the battle afar.
I stood beside him, feeling like Mazeppa
just before they let the horse
loose.</p>

<p>The outlook from the station is not
very attractive, and the first thing that
Uncle said was that he didn't believe it
was worth while stopping at all, and
that he had a good mind to go on with
the train; but just at that instant the
train went on by itself, so we did not
need to discuss the subject.</p>

<p>You see there is a high ridge that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
runs in front of the station, and Chartres
is on the other side. Nearly all the
towns here seem to be quite a little
ways from the railway stations. Mr.
Edgar says it's because the railroads
run after their passengers in Europe
instead of running over them, as they
do in America. Uncle says it's very
inconvenient, anyhow, and he pulled
his hat down hard and said, "Well,
let's have a look at the cathedral, anyway."</p>

<p>So we stormed the ridge forthwith,
and spread down into the flat country
beyond. As we descended the slope,
Uncle began to be glad he had come.
Chartres is very modest and mainly one
story high, so the Cathedral towers
aloft in a most soul-satisfying manner.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
Uncle said it was "Something like."
I was ever so glad that he felt so because
he said in Beauvais that something
he had read had led him to expect
that the cathedral there would
be big enough to hold the Bartholdi
Statue of Liberty in one of its niches,
and of course he was horribly disappointed,
as a consequence.</p>

<p>We walked straight to the cathedral,
and it was so big that Uncle thought
we had better each take one side and
meet behind, "so as to save time and
not miss anything." I acquiesced, because
I mean to keep him good-tempered,
if keeping good-tempered myself
and acquiescing will do so.</p>

<p>We started "fair" in front of the
middle front door, and I could hardly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
keep a straight face as we walked
promptly and solemnly off in opposite
directions. The cathedral is enormous
and just covered with carving, and I was
only part way down the side when I
saw Uncle coming around the corner,
swinging his umbrella in the briskest
sort of manner. He looked absolutely
disgusted when he saw me, and said in
the most injured tone imaginable,
"You must have been stopping to
look!"</p>

<p>He wouldn't hear to my continuing
my tour of circumnavigation, so we
went inside at once, and there I held
the guide-book and read the explanation
while he kept up a running contradiction
of everything I read. I don't
see the good of Uncle's carrying a guide-book,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
for he says they needn't suppose
he doesn't know better than most of it.</p>

<p>There is a wonderful carved marble
screen around the altar, and a sacred
statue with a yellow satin dress on; but
being inside made Uncle want to be
outside right away, so we left very
quickly, and then he studied the Baedeker
just long enough to let me notice
how all the Roman noses on the kings
and saints outside had been turned into
Eskimo noses by the rains of centuries;
and then he suddenly shut it, and said
we would go right straight off then and
there and see the famous enamels that
Diane de Poitiers gave Henry II. He
explained to me that this wasn't the
English Henry II, but the French
Henry II, and then he asked me which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
of us had the luggage-checks, and if I
had noticed whether the train went at
eleven or half-past. I must say it is
like doing multiplications in your head
to travel with Uncle, but of course I
enjoy it, and the walk to St. Peter's
Church was very pleasant, through
quaint streets and along by little canals
like those at Gisors.</p>

<p>The church was open, and open in
more ways than one, for they were
tearing up the whole floor to put in a
furnace and grave-stones and pick-axes
were leaning up against the columns
everywhere. There wasn't a soul to
be seen, and Uncle was so happy to be
able to poke about unconcierged for a
while that I sat down and let him
desecrate around with his cane until he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
came to with a start and asked me what
I supposed we came to Chartres for,
anyway. I got up at that, and we went
to look at the enamels, which are in
behind a locked balustrade and have
curtains hung in front of them besides.
We had to get a woman to unlock the
gate and draw the curtains aside and
explain which enamel was which
Apostle; and uncle was very much put
out over their being apostles at all. I
don't know what he expected in a
church, but he said he never thought
about the church; he only thought
about Diane de Poitiers. He says he
doesn't think it was in good taste her
having anything to do with the apostles,
and then he read in the book again and
found he'd made a mistake, and it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
the king who gave them to her, and not
she who gave them to the king, and
that used him all up, and he said he
wished that he had never come.</p>

<p>I saw that we should have to have
something to eat right off, so I said I
was hungry and Uncle said that was just
like a woman, but to come on. We
found a small restaurant and had a very
good lunch, and then Uncle said if I felt
satisfied he would take it as a personal
favor if we could go on to Dreux. I
do wish he wouldn't put everything
just that way when I really haven't
done anything; but he looked at his
watch and found that the time before
when he had looked at it he had looked
at it wrong and that we had barely ten
minutes to make the train. As a matter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
of fact, the train was going then, but
they don't go until ten minutes after in
France, so when you miss a train you
always have ten minutes left to make it.
We took a cab, and Uncle made the
man understand that if he hurried it
would pay; so we galloped madly over
the ridge and just got aboard in time to
learn that Uncle had left his cane in the
cab and that we'd forgotten our luggage
in <i>consigne</i>.</p>

<p>Of course the ride was rather gloomy,
because there was almost no way to lay
the blame on me; but after a while
Uncle asked me if I really ever did see
such a rank idiot as M. Sibilet, and he
felt better after that. We reached Dreux
about two o'clock, and I telegraphed
back about the luggage while Uncle
looked up a train for Argentan and set
his watch by the railway time. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
told me that the train that he had
decided on left at 3:04 and that we
could make it and see the mausoleum
"easy." I never contradict Uncle, because
it doesn't do any good and does
upset him awfully, so I went with him
to get the cab, and wondered how long
a mausoleum usually took to examine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span></p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;">
<a name="gs15" id="gs15"></a>
<img src="images/gs15.png" width="300" height="523" alt="Dreux" title="">
<span class="caption">Dreux</span></div>

<p>It seems that there are no cabs in
Dreux!</p>

<p>I thought that that would end the
mausoleum, but Uncle merely swept his
eyes over the prospect and said we'd
have to walk, and walk pretty prompt.
It was 2:10, and we walked fast. The
mausoleum is on top of a hill, and Uncle
said we could catch our breath after we
got to the top. We never spoke a word
going up. I knew that I was too young<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
to die of heart-disease, so I didn't care,
if he didn't.</p>

<p>It was a terrible climb, but we reached
there at 2:32. It's the mausoleum of the
Orléans family, and is modern. There
is a concierge who takes you around, and
we followed him, Uncle with his watch
in his hand and going on like this:
"2:40&mdash;tomb of the king's mother, eh?
Fine old lady! 2:41&mdash;tomb of the Duc
d'Aumale; good face, handsome decorations
on his bosom, stained-glass windows&mdash;all
made at Sévres, eh? 2:43&mdash;"
etc. You can imagine!</p>

<p>But what you can't imagine is the
sublime and peaceful beauty of all those
exquisite marble people sleeping there
under the slanting rainbow sun-rays of
the magnificent windows. They affected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
me so deeply that, in spite of Uncle, I
could hardly keep back the tears. They
didn't seem living and they didn't
seem dead; I don't know what they
were like&mdash;spirits made visible, perhaps.
The Duchesse d'Orléans has her arm
stretched across, so that it touches her
husband, who was the eldest son of
Louis Philippe. The king himself
stands upright in the midst of them all,
and Queen Marie Amélie kneels at his
side in a beautiful pose. Two precious
little babies are sculptured together on
one tomb, and all the while we were
going about, the place resounded with
the echoes of the chisels that were preparing
a place for the Prince Henry
who was killed in Africa.</p>

<p>I could have stayed there hours,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
wrapped up in the mystery and wonder
of it all, but Uncle fell down some steps
while he was looking at his watch, and
we departed forthwith. He said we
must walk fast, and so again we walked
fast. Of course it was easier, though,
going down-hill, and I said, when we
were near enough not to be anxious
any more, "It was worth seeing, wasn't
it?" To which Uncle replied: "Yes,
if you enjoy that kind of thing; but all
I could think of was the idea of spending
such a lot of money on statues and
then not having any cabs at the depot."</p>

<p>There was no time to get anything
more to eat at the moment, so I just
held my tongue until we were safely on
the train again.</p>

<p>We reached Argentan at 6:15 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
and I felt as if I'd been running Uncle,
or, rather, running with Uncle, for a
month.</p>

<p>The next morning we were called at
seven, and I really thought that I could
not get up at first; but, I made it at the
third try, and Uncle and I were out
"seeing Argentan" at eight. At half-past
he declared that there was really
nothing to see, so we went to the <i>gare</i>,
and he bought a Paris "Herald." As
we were sitting there waiting for the
8:04 train to Coulib&#339;uf, in came Elfrida
Sanders and her sister with bicycles. I
was <i>so</i> astonished, and Uncle was rather
pleased, too. They are doing Normandy
on wheels, and they have their tools and
a kodak and a small set of toilet-things
and four clean collars all tied on to them.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
Elfrida says they've had a lovely time&mdash;only
broken glass once, and rain two
days. The sister is going to write a
book and call it "Two on a Trot." I
think that's a funny name for a bicycle
story. Uncle said to call it "Two on a
Tire"; but you know how stupid Elfrida
is, and so she said, "Oh, but
it's not a tandem." They were going
to Coulib&#339;uf, too, but we couldn't go
together because they were traveling
third-class. Elfrida says they are seeing
Europe nicely on less than a dollar a
day, and Uncle said "Great Scott!"</p>

</div>


<p>While we were on the train it began
to rain and then it poured. Uncle became
very gloomy and said that is just
what we might have expected. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
didn't expect rain, and I didn't see
why I should have expected it, so I
only nodded. Uncle didn't like my
nodding, and said I shouldn't take
such a pessimistic view of life at my
age. While he was talking I suddenly
remembered the umbrella and asked
him where it was, and he had left it in
Argentan! Then there was no more
conversation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span></p>

<span class="caption">Falaise</span>
</div>


<p>We had to change cars at Coulib&#339;uf,
and we reached Falaise about noon.
Elfrida and her sister got right on to
their wheels and bumped gaily away
over the cobblestones at once. The
rain was over and the sun was shining,
but Uncle said he had lost all faith in
France and wanted to buy another
umbrella the very first thing. We<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
went to a store, and he said to buy a
cheap one, as I would be sure to lose
it. I asked for a cheap one, but the
woman was quite indignant and said that
she did not keep any cheap umbrellas&mdash;that
the lowest she had was two
francs&mdash;forty cents. I had to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
translate it to Uncle, and he was so
amused that he bought one for three
francs and gave a franc to her baby
that was tied in a high chair by the
window.</p>

<p>Then we took a cab to the castle
and paid the man at the entrance and
let him go. There is a lovely sloping
road that follows the curve of the outer
wall up to the summit of the hill, and
we forgot how tired we were in thinking
how pretty it was. These old
castle enclosures are all so big. This
one contains a college at one end, and
then there is quite a wood which you
must walk through before you come to
the castle itself at the other end.</p>

<p>The castle is wonderful. It is splendid
and big and old and strong and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
Norman. It is built out of the red
rock, and it has oubliettes and wells and
pits and towers and everything of the
kind that heart could wish to see. We
saw the room where Prince Arthur
was imprisoned for seven years and the
room where William the Conqueror
was born. It's a very little room in
which to have had such a wonderful
thing happen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span></p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;">

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span></p>
</div>

<p>Uncle enjoyed the castle immensely;
he took the deepest interest in every
inch of it, and when the concierge
showed us the window from which
Robert the Devil first saw Arlette, he
planted himself firmly inside it and I
almost thought that he was going to
stay there forever. My feet ached so
that I was glad enough to lean up anywhere<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
for a minute, and I honestly
believe that it was ten before he
moved. Then he gave himself a little
shake and said: "Well to think of
owning this place, and being able to
stand in a window as high up as that
one, and then to look down as far as
that well is, and then only to need to
say, 'Bring her up!' and to know she'd
got to come! Great Scott! No wonder
their son conquered England. I'm
only surprised that he didn't wipe
Europe off the face of the continent!"
Then he shook his head for quite a
little while, and we got under way
again and went to Talbot's Tower.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span></p>
</div>

<p>It's high, and Uncle wanted to climb
it. I didn't mind his climbing it, but
he wanted me to climb it, too, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
some one was ringing the bell, so the
concierge had to leave us and go back
before anything was settled. Uncle said
it was rather hard when he was doing
so much to try and finish me up (he
meant "finish me off," I think), for
me to be so lukewarm about being
finished so I started in to climb, although
my knees felt like crumpled
tissue-paper. <a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>The steps were so worn
that it was awful work and Uncle
would go up as far as anyone could.
He had the umbrella and I had the
candle and often we had to step two
and even three steps at once. When
we came to the place where the steps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
ended, he stood and peeked out of a
window (imagining himself Lord Talbot,
I reckon&mdash;) and then we started
back. The coming down was awful,&mdash;I
was honestly frightened. Uncle went
first and I stepped on his coat twice
and spilt candle-grease on his hat.
Uncle found it easier coming down
than going up, and it wasn't until we
reached the bottom that we discovered
that the reason why was because he had
left the umbrella behind and so had
two hands to hold on by. I said,
"Never mind, it only cost sixty cents";
but he was not to be comforted, and
said bitterly, "You forget the franc that
I gave her baby." I would have gone
back for it, but I felt so hot and tired.</p>

<p>We came to Caen this noon, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
went to bed, and I don't believe we
shall ever get up again. Uncle said
that with my kind permission he would
suggest that I should not disturb him,
and heaven knows that I have no desire
to. I telegraphed Mrs. Clary about
mail, and then I went to sleep and I
slept until just now.</p>

<p>I never was so near dead in all my
life; but you mustn't think for a
minute that I'm not having a lovely
time, for I am, and it was so kind of
Uncle to bring me. Now good-by,
and with much love,</p>

<p class="center">UNCLE JOHN PARALYZED</p>
<br>

<p><span class="dropcap">"C</span><span class="smcap">ome in</span>! Come on! Well,
don't you hear? Can't you
understand any&mdash;Oh, it's you,
child. I thought it was one of those
darned waiters.</p>

<p>"Sit down; pull up a chair by the bed.
It's so long since I sent for you that I
just about thought that you were not
coming. I suppose you were surprised
at my sending for you; but it was the
only way to do. It's a hard thing to
break to you, Yvonne; but you'd have
to know in the course of the day, and I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
always do everything right off that I've
not decided to wait and see about. Now
don't look frightened, my dear; nobody's
<i>dead</i>&mdash;it's only that I'm paralyzed!</p>

<p>"There, what do you think of that?
Yes, it's true for a fact. My legs! I
had some premonitory symptoms yesterday
going up that cursed old tower, and
I had some very advanced ones coming
down from it; and this morning, when
I started to shave, the truth just burst
in my face. Now, don't try to say anything,
for I've read too many patent-medicine
advertisements not to recognize
paralysis when I feel it up and down the
back of my own legs. I'm not the
man not to know my own feelings, and
I want to tell you that when I got up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
this morning I couldn't stand up, and
then, after I stood up, I couldn't sit
down; and if that isn't a clear case of
having completely given out, I don't
know what you would call it.</p>

<p>"Now, my dear, the question is,
what's to be done? Of course our
travels have come to a full stop, for I
shall probably never walk again. The
curious thing is that I don't feel any
particular inclination ever to walk again.
You've no conception of the sentiments
that I feel in my legs; but if you roll the
fatigue of a lifetime into either the left
or the right, you can get some faint
inkling of the first freshness of paralysis.
I tell you, Yvonne, it is awful. Every
cobblestone I've gone over seems to be
singing in my calves; but that's neither<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
here nor there. What I want you to
do is to go to the pocket of my valise
get out the cable-code book and look
out a word that means 'Both legs paralyzed.
What shall I do with the girls?'
You'll find a word that means it, if you
look long enough. They've got forty
pages of words that mean every fool
thing on earth from 'It's a boy' to 'Impossible
to lend you ten dollars.' I was
reading it over in Paris the other day
while I waited for my money at the bank.</p>

<p>"Well, ain't you going to get the
code-book? I don't want to be impatient,
but I want some one to be doing
something. You don't know how restless
it makes me to think of lying still
for the rest of my life. While I was
waiting for you, I was thinking that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
probably I shall live right here in Caen
till I die. I'm very glad we got here
too late to see anything, because now I
can take it bit by bit and drag it out
through my remaining days. I shall
have a wheeling-chair and a man to push
me around, and&mdash;well, maybe it's in
the little outside pocket. I know I had
it in Paris, anyhow; I remember I was
just reading that 'salsify' means 'Your
mother-in-law left by the ten o'clock
train,' and that 'salsifry' means that she
didn't, when they brought me my
money, and I was free to go.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span></p>
</div>



<p>"Well, now you've got it. I thought
maybe it would be in the little valise all
the time. Seems to me the sicknesses
begin with 'Salt.' I remember 'Saltfish'
means 'have got smallpox; keep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
away,' and 'Saltpetre' means 'have got
a cold; come at once.' You look along
there and find 'paralysis.' I'll just keep
quiet while you're looking. I'd better
be learning to keep quiet. Keeping
quiet must be the long suit of the paralyzed,
I should fancy. But you see
what it is now to be an optimist.
Here's my life practically over all of a
sudden, and, instead of being blue, I'm
as cheerful as a cricket. No need of
fussing over the candle-grease on my
hat now, for I shall never wear a hat
again, I shall wear a soft felt tied over
my ears with a plaid shawl as they
always do in rolling-chairs; as for the
umbrella, I'm actually glad I left it.
It would only have been an aggravation
to have seen it lying around. But all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
the same I can't see why you didn't
notice it lying down there. It must
have been in plain sight,&mdash;I remember
pointing over at Mont Mirat with it,
and saying the rock looked as if it had
been dropped there from above. Yvonne,
I tell you when I think of all we did
these last two days I feel perfectly content
to be paralyzed. I'm glad to think
that I've got such a good excuse to stay
right in bed; I'm happy that it will be
out of the question for me ever to travel
again. I feel as if I've traveled enough
to last me forever; I actually don't want
to see anything more. No more catching
trains and climbing castles for your
Uncle John&mdash;not in his life. You can
put the Baedeker in the fire right now&mdash;I
never want to see a red cover or a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
green string or an index again as long as
I live. What's that? No, I sha'n't
want it to look over and recall things by;
I can recall more than I want to just by
the way I feel. I don't need any guide-book
to remember what I've been
through since I left Paris. I remember
too much. I remember so much that
I am rejoiced to think that muscles over
which I have no control will prevent my
having to go out to-day and see anything
else. It seems a little hard to
think of having sight-seen so hard that
you never want to see another sight, but
I'm perfectly content. And I don't
want a doctor, either; I've no faith in
French doctors. It would be just like
one to hypnotize me and set me going
again, and I don't want to go. I want<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
to lie right here, and I thank the Lord
that I have money enough to allow me
to lie here forever, if I feel like it. I
was thinking this morning what a horrible
existence a tramp must lead&mdash;always
going on to new places. Thank
Heaven, I can just settle down in this
old one and stay on indefinitely. I want
you to go down to the office and ask
what rate they'll make for this room
by the year. I want this same room
right along. It's the first restful spot
I've struck since my trunk went smash
into that ship. Yvonne, did you notice
the way they handled those trunks when
we landed&mdash;as if they were eggs? I tell
you, the baggage system at home is a
burning disgrace. That's one reason I
like Europe so&mdash;it's quiet and peaceful.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
I heard some goats go by this morning;
I'd like to know a hotel in America
where you can listen to a goat. And
then that wallpaper, what a tranquil
pattern&mdash;a basket of sunflowers upside
down alternately with a single palm upside
up! What a contrast to the paper
on that room I sailed from! It looked
more like snakes doing physical culture
than anything else.</p>

<p>"Yvonne, I was thinking it all over
as I lay here this morning waiting for
you, and the truth is, we've been traveling
too fast. I wanted you to see all
there was to see, and I overlooked myself
completely. Don't feel badly, child,
because I know you never meant it; but it
<i>is</i> the truth, and, as a consequence,
here I lie paralyzed. Yes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
we've been traveling too fast. It's the
vice of the American abroad; it's the
terrible secret drain upon the strength
of our better classes. We come over to
rest, and if we don't do two countries
a week we feel we've wasted our
money. The idea of leaving Paris in
the morning and doing Chartres and
Dreux and getting to Argentan that
night! Why, Hercules himself would
have been used up. And then that
castle at Falaise. But I'm not sorry
that I went to Falaise. No, I'm not
sorry. Yvonne, there was something
about that castle that I'll never get
over. I tell you those were the days
to live in! I was thinking about it
while I was waiting for you this morning.
Will you consider what it must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
have been to put on a suit that you
couldn't be punched through, and then
get out with an ax that faced two ways
and have full freedom to hack at people
you hated. I tell you, child, I should
have been one of those who barricaded
themselves behind the dead bodies they
had killed and kept right on firing over
the top. And to-day my armor would
be hanging up somewhere all full of
dents and rusty blood-stains, and I'd be
a sight in some cathedral with your
Aunt Jane wearing a funnel and an
accordion beside me. We'd both be
in marble, of course, some worn by
time and some chipped by tourists&mdash;ah,
well!</p>

<p>"Can't you find anything suitable in
that code-book? Here, I've been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
waiting a quarter of an hour for you to
hunt&mdash;hand me the book. I remember
'Shell' is 'have broken my left leg,'
and 'Shell-fish' is 'have broken my
right leg,' and 'Shawl' is&mdash;wait a bit&mdash;keep
still, Yvonne; no one in the
wide world can study a code and listen
at the&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh, well, I'll leave it till to-night.
Not that I'm irritated at your interruption,
for I never let anything ruffle
me, and when you write home the
first thing I want you to tell your
mother is that being paralyzed has not
changed me one particle. Same even
disposition, same calm outlook on life,
same disinclination to ever bother anyone.
I want you to make them understand
in particular how cheerful I am.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
Some men would turn cynical at
waking up paralyzed, but not me. I
feel as if I might get about quite a
little in Caen, maybe even get to
Falaise again some time; but you can
bank on one thing, and that is that if I
ever go back to Falaise I won't go up
that tower again. I was wondering
this morning as I lay here waiting for
you how in thunder you were holding
that candle to spill so much grease on
my hat. You can't say that you didn't
know I was there, for every second
step you took your foot hit me in the
small of the back. You ought to have
gone first, anyhow. I know the rule
is for a man to go first going down a
staircase, but I don't call that business
we were on any staircase; it was more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
like a series of cascades with us forming
the merry, leaping, part. I tell you
what, Yvonne, the next time it's up to
your Uncle John to play the chamois
that springs from crag to crag over an
old middle-aged staircase while his niece
pours candle-grease on his hat, you can
excuse me.</p>

<p>"What I like is clean, open-to-the-day-light
ruins like that old one at
Jumièges! No peril, no anxiety&mdash;all
on a level, and time to look up at what
wasn't. I tell you, I wouldn't have
missed seeing Jumièges for anything.
I was thinking this morning as I lay
here waiting for you that I have a good
mind to write a book about my travels,
and that when I do I shall have the
frontispiece, me in front of Jumièges.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
I could take an artist down there on
purpose, and while he wasn't doing
me, I could look it all over again.
Maybe I could go there alone with a
kodak and get a satisfactory frontispiece,
only those rocks were so thick that
most people would think it was a defective
plate. I shouldn't like to have
them think that, for if I was going to
have a book at all, I should have it in
good style&mdash;gold edges, bevel-plate, and
so forth, don't you know. I'd like to
write a book about Europe, I vow. I
haven't been here very long, but I'll
swear I know ten times more than any
book ever tells. It never said a word
in Baedeker about there not being any
cabs at Dreux, or about the condition
of those steps in Talbot's Tower, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
such things ought to be known. It's
all right to make light of perils past,
but those steps were too dark for me to
ever make light of in this world. Up
toward the top where we had to sit
down and stretch for the next one&mdash;you
remember?&mdash;I must own that I was
honestly sorry I came.</p>

<p>"Well, my child, it must be nearing
noon, and I feel like taking a nap before
dinner. Suppose you go in and
write to your mother and Mrs. Clary.
After your mother gets the cable, she'll
naturally be anxious for details, and she
won't want to wait longer than ten
days to know all. I wish you'd ring
and tell them to bring me some hot
water before you go; tell them I want
it in a pitcher. Make them understand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
a pitcher. They brought it last
night in a sort of brass cylinder, and I
couldn't get the thing open anyway&mdash;had
to use it for a hot-water-bag in bed
in the end. It worked fine for that.
Never cooled off all night, in fact, I
couldn't put my feet against it till
morning.</p>

<p>"There, now, you go on and leave
me to sleep. You haven't the faintest
idea of how used-up I feel. Don't
forget to write your mother how cheerful
I am; don't forget the hot water.
I'll send for you when I want you.
There&mdash;there&mdash;I'm all right, child,
don't you worry. Just pull the curtains
and let me sleep."</p><br>

<p><span class="dropcap">D</span><span class="smcap">earest Mama</span>: We are still
there, and I'm so happy
Uncle is in bed, and at first
he thought he was paralyzed, but now he
says he's only refusing to take chances.
It's so nice having him in bed, because
Lee is here, and Uncle makes it all
right without knowing anything about
it. It was yesterday that he thought
he was paralyzed; he sent for me before
I was awake to tell me. I was so
dreadfully stiff and lame that I thought
at first that I could not get up; but of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
course I did, and went to him as soon
as I could. He told me that he was
paralyzed, really paralyzed; but I wasn't
frightened, because, when he explained
his feelings, I knew every one of them,
and of course I knew that I wasn't paralyzed.
Only when he rolled around
upon his pillows and said he certainly
would end his days right here in Caen,
I couldn't help wishing that he had
left me to enjoy my pillows, also.</p>

<p>But he wanted to talk, so I listened
for ever so long; and then he wanted to
sleep, so I came away to write you, and
there was a note from Lee in my room.
He was down-stairs waiting, and I went
right down, and my, but it was good to
see him! I didn't kiss him, because it
was a hotel parlor, even if we don't<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
know any one in Caen; but I told him
about Uncle, and he said it was fine and
that he hoped he would be in bed a
week, but no such luck. The yacht
has broken a thumb-screw, or whatever
it is on a yacht, and they have all come
here to meet some automobile people.
Lee looks real well; he says he's had
no end of fun lately, and that it is a
shame I can't go, too.</p>

<p>While we were talking, Mrs. Catherwood-Chigley
came in. I didn't know
that she was in Europe, and Lee was
dreadfully put out for she sat right down
and asked all about us. Lee explained
that he was here with a yacht and that
I was here with Uncle; but she didn't
seem to believe us, and shook her head,
and asked about Mrs. Clary. She said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
Mr. Chigley was here, too, and they
have seen a monument in the cemetery
here that is just what they want for
Mr. Catherwood. She says Mr. Catherwood
was so clear-cut and Doric in
his ideas that it has been very hard to
find the right thing. She said Mr.
Chigley was out making a sketch of the
monument then. She says Mr. Chigley
is devotion itself to Mr. Catherwood's
memory, and cabled a beautiful wreath
on his wedding anniversary and palms
tied with purple the day he died. She
said she was very happy, and Mr. Chigley
just loves to hear her tell stories
about Mr. Catherwood by the hour.
Lee was awfully rude and kept yawning,
and I know she didn't like it by the
way she looked at him. It was awfully<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
trying to have her just then, because, of
course, there's no telling how long
Uncle will stay paralyzed. We really
thought she would stay until lunch-time,
but Lee yawned so that she went at last.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span></p>
</div>

<p>Lee said that we ought to join them
in the touring-cars and do Brittany that
way, but he didn't like to tackle Uncle.
He says Uncle is a very tough proposition,
because he is so devilish observing,
and he never begged my pardon for
saying it, either. Of course Uncle
brought me, and I must do as he wishes,
but I do wish that he liked Lee. Lee
says he wishes he liked him, too; he
says it would be so devilish convenient
just now, and he didn't beg my pardon
that time, either.</p>

</div>

<p>I ran up, and Uncle was still asleep,
so I had lunch with Lee at the table
d'hôte. Mr. Chigley and Mrs. Catherwood-Chigley
sat opposite, and she does look
so funny with her wedding-rings
and engagement-rings alternating on the
same finger. Mr. Chigley said he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
should call on Uncle, and Lee and I
were frightened to death until I remembered
that Uncle wouldn't be able to
read the card or understand the waiter
without me. After luncheon I ran up
again, and Uncle was still asleep, so we
went out to walk. We had a lovely
walk, and never looked at a sight, and
when we came back I ran up again,
and Uncle was still asleep; so Lee and
I sat down in the parlor, and we were
just going to be so happy when Pinkie
and Bunnie Clemens came in. Well,
really, I hardly knew either, they have
changed so, and Pinkie has a beard and
Bunnie is over six feet high. They are
on a bicycle tour with eight men, and
they saw Elfrida and her sister yesterday,
headed for Bayeux. Pinkie says<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
it's been such bad weather they've
had to tie umbrellas and waterproofs to
them, too. He says Elfrida looks half-witted,
and her sister looks like a full
idiot. I was so glad that I had on a
Paris frock. They wanted me to go to
the theater with them, but of course I
couldn't, for I couldn't be sure about
Uncle's staying paralyzed.</p>

<p>He slept till eight o'clock last night,
and then he had dinner and went right
to sleep again, so I could have gone to
the theater after all; but how could I
know to dare to risk it?</p>

<p>Lee and the men from the yacht are
at another hotel, so he didn't come very
early this morning, and it was fortunate,
because Uncle sent for me about
nine to explain Mr. Chigley's card,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
which they poked under the door last
night. Uncle was so curious to know
what it was that he got out of bed and
found he could walk. He said he had
never felt sure that it was paralysis, only
he wanted to be on the safe side, and
he is in bed still, only he is so lively
that I am half crazy over Lee. If Uncle
concludes he's all right, and comes
down and finds Lee, I know he isn't
going to like it at all. Pinkie and Bunnie
have gone on to Mont St. Michel,
and the Catherwood-Chigleys took the
train for Dol right after breakfast. Mr.
Chigley was very sorry not to see Uncle,
and Mrs. Catherwood-Chigley said
she should write you all about how
well and happy I was looking. I know
that what she really means to write<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
about is Lee; but you know all about
him, so I don't care.</p>

<p>Lee says if there was time he'd go to
Paris and get a nurse and an electric-battery
and have Uncle kept just comfortably
paralyzed for a few more days, but
there isn't time, and I am so worried.
If Uncle loses any more patience with
Lee, he won't have any patience left at
all, and I'll have to go all of the rest
of the trip that way. We took a walk
this afternoon to consult, and we saw
Elfrida and her sister. They have cut
off their hair, because it bothered them
so, coming down in their eyes, and Elfrida
says she feels all the freedom of a
man thrilling through her&mdash;you know
how funny she always talks. They have
seven calloused places on the inside of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
each hand from the handle-bars, and
Elfrida says she's sure their insteps will
arch forever after. They were coming
out of St. Stephen's Church, and the
only way to get rid of them was to say
that we were just going in; so we said it,
and went in.</p>

<p>It was really very interesting, and the
tomb of William the Conqueror is
there. He built St. Stephen's, and Mathilde
built La Trinité at the other end
of the town, partly as a thank-offering
for conquering England and partly as a
penance for being cousins. There was
a monastery with St. Stephen's and a
convent with La Trinité until the Revolution
changed everything. William's
tomb is just a flat slab in front of the
altar, but he really isn't there any more,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
for they have dug him up and scattered
him over and over again. The church
is tremendously big and plain, and
every word you even whisper echoes so
much that Lee and I thought we'd better
come out where we could talk alone.</p>

<p>When we came back to the hotel, I
ran up, and the mail had come from
Paris; so Uncle said if I'd fill his fountain-pen,
he'd just spend the afternoon
letting a few people in America know
what Europe was really like. I'm a
little bit troubled, for I'm all over being
stiff and sore from that climbing,
and yet he seems to feel almost as mean
as ever. He has his meals in his room,
for, although we're on the first floor,
he says he cannot even think calmly of
a stair-case yet. He says that Talbot's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
Tower seems to have settled in his
calves, and Heaven knows when he'll
get over it. Lee says I ought not to
worry, but to make the most out of the
situation; but I do worry, because Uncle
is so uncertain. And I'm perfectly
positive that there will be an awful scene
when he finds out that during his paralysis
I've been going all over with
Lee.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span></p>
</div>

<p>Lee and I went to walk this afternoon,
and we visited the old, old church
of St. Nicolas. It said in the book that
the apse still had its original stone roof,
and Lee said it would be a good chance
to learn what an apse was; so we set
out to go there, but we forgot all about
where we set out for, and it was five
o'clock before we finally got back to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
where it was. It stands in an old cemetery,
and it says in the book that it
has been secularized; so we climbed up
on gravestones till we could see in the
windows and learn what that meant,
also. The gravestones were all covered
with lichen and so slippery that in
the end Lee gave up and just helped
me to look. We didn't learn much,
though, for it was only full of hay.</p>

<p>When we got back to the hotel, I
ran up, and Uncle was gone! I never
was so frightened in my life, and when
I ran back and told Lee, he whistled,
so I saw that he was upset, too. He
said I'd better go to my room and wait,
and he'd dine at his hotel to-night; so
I went to my room, and Uncle was
there, hunting all through my things<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
for the address-book. I was so glad and
relieved that I didn't mind a bit the
way he had churned everything up, although
you ought to see my trunk, and
I kissed him and told him it was just
splendid to see him beginning to go
about again. He looked pleased, but
he says the backs of his legs are still beyond
the power of description, and so I
proposed having dinner with him in his
room, which we did very comfortably,
and he told me that he should remember
this trip till the day he died, without
any regard for the grease I spilt on
his hat. After dinner he was very fidgety,
and I can see that the confinement
is wearing on him; but I don't know
what to do.</p>

<p>More letters came by the evening<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
mail, and Mrs. Clary is so in raptures
over the dinner that when Uncle asked
me if I had heard from her I thought
it was wisest to say no, because I knew
that if he read how happy M. Sibilet
was making her, he surely wouldn't
like it at all.</p>

<p>Lee sent me a note by a messenger
about eleven o'clock, with instructions
in French on the outside about their
delivering it to me when I was <i>not</i> with
Uncle. They delivered it all right,
and I read it. He just said that the
automobiles had come, and that he was
going to cast his die clean over the
Rubicon to-morrow morning at eleven.
That means that he is going, of course,
and that I am to be left here all alone.
I do feel very badly over it, for Uncle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
will be almost sure to find out about
Lee whenever he can get downstairs
again, and then I'm sure I don't know
what will happen. Of course I've not
done anything that I shouldn't have
done; but, dear me! doing right
doesn't help if Uncle chooses to decide
that it is wrong. And if he can't walk,
to let us go on traveling, he's going to
keep getting more and more difficult to
get along with. I don't like to tell
Lee how troubled I am, because if Lee
gets worked up and decides to take a
hand in while I'm traveling with
Uncle, I might as well be Mr. Pickwick
when he rushed between just in
time to get the tongs on one side and
the shovel on the other. I don't want
Lee trying to defend me from Uncle,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
because I know Uncle would never
forgive him for thinking I needed defending.
You know yourself just how
Uncle is, and now that his legs are so
stiff he is more that way than ever.
Lee doesn't understand, and I can't
make him understand, and perhaps it's
just as well that he should go on to-morrow.
Maybe Uncle will be better
in a few days, so that we can visit
Bayeux. He's crazy to go to Bayeux
and see the tapestry, and it isn't so very
far. But what shall we do if we come
to any town again where there are no
cabs! It would be awful.</p>

<p>However, I shall not worry, for it's
no use. Mrs. Catherwood-Chigley
wrote me her address on one of her
cards, and Lee took it and sent it to me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
with some beautiful flowers. He
thought it was such a clever, safe idea;
but just suppose we meet them again!
If I didn't think Lee was just right, I'd
think he had almost too many clever
ideas; and, anyhow, I know that I'm
sure that he has too many while I'm
traveling with Uncle.</p>

<p>Now, good-night, it's so very late.
Don't ever feel troubled over me, for
I'm having a splendid time, and it was
so kind of Uncle to bring us.</p>

happiest thing in the whole
wide world, and Lee is the
grandest fellow! I must write you
everything, and you will see.</p>

<p>The morning after I last wrote,
Uncle had me waked up at seven and
wrote on a scrap of paper, "We leave
for Bayeux at 8.30." I was just about
sick, for I knew he wasn't able to, and
then, besides, if we left so early, I surely
shouldn't see Lee again. But I got up
and dressed, of course, and I was beside<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
myself to find some way of sending Lee
a scrap of a good-by before we took a
cab for the <i>gare</i>. Uncle was in high
spirits over getting out again, and all
went well until it came the minute to
get him on to the train. Well, I do
believe he was scared himself. Getting
on to a French train is almost like
going up a ladder that slopes the wrong
way, I always think, and it took two
commissionaires to hoist Uncle into
the coupé. He was awfully worried
over it, I could see, for he talked about
what an outrageous idiot Mr. Chopstone
was all the way to Bayeux. We had to
get out there, of course, and I was beside
myself to know how to manage.
In the end Uncle came down so suddenly
that he nearly crushed me and a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
meek, good-hearted little Frenchman
who had kindly offered to help assist.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;">

<img src="images/gs24.png" width="300" height="472" alt="" title="">
<span class="caption">Bayeux</span>
</div>


<p>The <i>gare</i> at Bayeux is quite a walk
from the part of the town where the
sights are and there wasn't a cab or a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
thing on wheels. I didn't dare look at
Uncle, for there is no train back till
four in the afternoon. He seemed a
bit staggered at first, and then he said
well, it was level, and we'd go leisurely
along and enjoy the fresh, pure, sweet
air of the country. So we walked along,
but I could see he wasn't enjoying it a
bit, and it took us a half-hour to get to
where we were going. We went to
the cathedral first, and Uncle sat right
down and said he wanted time enough
to enjoy the ground-work of the vaulting
and that I could just leave him and
go around alone. It was my first
chance to look at anything as slow as I
liked, and I really did enjoy myself very
much.</p>

<p>It's a really wonderful old cathedral,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
and I found a nice old sacristan
behind the altar, and he took me underneath
into the crypt, and the crypt is
the original church where Harold took
the oath. It was slowly buried by the
dirt of centuries, and when they started
to put a furnace in a few years ago, they
found it and dug it out again. It isn't
very large, and the walls are of stone
several feet thick, with little bits of
arched windows set up too high to see
from.</p>

<p>When I came back we went to see
the tapestry in the museum, and it isn't
really tapestry at all: it's a long, long
strip of linen about a foot wide, with
scenes embroidered on it in Kensington,
and over and over. It's really very
well done, and it isn't a bit badly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
worn out&mdash;only a few little holes here
and there. The scenes are very interesting,
and some of them are awfully
funny. The way they hauled the
horses over the sides of the boats when
they landed in England, for example.
The Saxons have beards, and the Normans
are shaven. I couldn't help
thinking how funny it was that the
Normans, who were regarded as barbarians
by the French, were looked upon
as tremendously effete by the English.
Uncle took a deal of pleasure studying
the whole thing, and we were there till
it was time for lunch. We had a nice
lunch at a clean little place, and then
came the rub. There was nothing to
do till train-time, and that terrible walk
to the <i>gare</i>. I had brought a book<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
along, so I could read aloud, but Uncle
said only a woman would come to
Bayeux and read a novel, and that I
reminded him of Aunt Jane. You
know how terrible it is when any one
reminds him of Aunt Jane; so I closed
the book at once, and said I'd do anything
he liked. He said that that was
more like Aunt Jane than ever, to just
sit back and throw the whole burden
on to him; and then he shook his
watch and held it to his ear and said
"Hum!" too, one right after the other.
I was almost beside myself to know
what to do or what to suggest, and just
then something came puffing up behind
us and stopped right at our side. It
was a big automobile, with three men
in it, and one jerked off his mask and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
jumped out over the wheel and grabbed
Uncle by the hand. And it was Lee!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span></p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;">

<span class="caption">"And it was Lee"</span>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span></p>
</div>

<p>You never saw anything like Uncle's
face! He seemed reparalyzed for a few
seconds, and Lee kept shaking his hand
and telling him how glad he was to see
him, and how he <i>must</i> get right into
the automobile and go on with them to
Caen. My heart just about stopped
beating, I was so anxious, but Lee never
stopped shaking, and the other men took
off their masks and got out, too, and told
Uncle he really must do them the honor
and give them the pleasure, and in the
end we got him in, and Lee won out.</p>

<p>Oh, it was such fun! We had the
most glorious trip back to Caen. They
had an extra mask along, and Uncle
wore it and sat on the front seat, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
Mr. Peters, the man who owns the
automobile, was really lovely to him.
The other man and Lee and I sat behind,
and the other man is Mr. Peters's
mother's son by her second husband. His
name is Archie Stowell, and I should
judge that Mr. Peters's mother's second
husband was a lot livelier than the first,
but not so clever. Mr. Peters is really
awfully clever, and the way he talked
to Uncle was wonderful. Uncle said it
was a very smooth-riding automobile,
and Mr. Peters said it did him good all
through to meet some one who recognized
the good points of a good machine
at once; he said not one man in a thousand
had brains enough to know a good
machine when he was in it, and that
he was overjoyed to have accidentally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
met the one man who did discriminate.
And Uncle said he should judge that
automobiling was a very easy way of
getting over the ground when one was
traveling in Europe, and Mr. Peters
said it was perfectly bewildering how
the breadth and scope of Uncle's mind
could instantaneously seize and weigh
every side of an intricate proposition and
as instantaneously solve it completely.
By the time we reached Caen Uncle
was so saturated with Mr. Peters that
he even smiled on Lee as we got out
and asked them all three to dine with
us at eight. They accepted, and went
to their hotel to dress, and Uncle went
to his room without one word of any
kind to me.</p>

<p>They came, and we had a very nice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
dinner in a little separate room, and the
way Mr. Peters talked to Uncle was
worth listening to surely. And when
Uncle was talking, he leaned forward
and paid attention as if his life depended
on every word. By ten o'clock Uncle
was happier than I have almost ever
seen him, and Mr. Peters said it was no
use, we just simply must join their party
and go on in the automobile. Lee began
to laugh when he said that, and
said: "Now, Peters, you'll learn the
sensation of getting turned down cold."
It was an awful second for me, because
I just felt Uncle's terrible battle between
not wanting to go on with Lee and wanting
to contradict him; but in the end
the wanting to contradict overpowered
everything else, and he said: "Young<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
man, when you are as old as I am you'll
be less ready to speak for other people
than you seem disposed to do now."</p>

<p>And then he accepted Mr. Peters's
invitation! So will you only please to
think of it&mdash;we are touring with Lee,
and to-day we came up through the
lovely valley of the Vire to this little
town of the same name. It is all too
nice for words; Uncle sits on the front
seat all the time, and when he gives
Mr. Peters advice, Mr. Peters always
thanks him and says that he never met
any one before with sense enough to
have figured that out.</p>

<p>We passed Elfrida and her sister to-day,
pedaling along for dear life. They
didn't know us, and they are getting to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
look so awful that I thought it was just
as well. Uncle says he thinks they are
seeing Europe for thirty cents a day
now.</p>

<p class="center">YVONNE TO HER MOTHER</p>
<br>

<p class="rthead"><i>Vire.</i></p>

<p><span class="dropcap">D</span><span class="smcap">earest Mama</span>: We are
still here in Vire, and we cannot
go on for it is raining awfully.
It rained all yesterday, and we had
<i>more</i> fun. About ten in the morning an
automobile arrived with a lady Lee
knows named Mrs. Brewer and three
men, and about twelve another automobile
arrived with Clara and Emily
Kingsley and their aunt Clara Emily
and Ellsworth Grimm and Jim Freeman
and a chauffeur, and about half-past
one a runabout automobile camein with the two Tripps. We are like
a big house-party, and Mr. Peters plays
poker with Uncle every minute, so we.
can all have no end of a good time

<p>I must explain to you about Mr.
Peters, because Lee explained to me. I
was so troubled over Mr. Peters being
so devoted to Uncle and never winning
a single jack-pot once himself that Lee
told me all about how it is. It seems
that Mr. Peters's mother was married
to Mr. Peters's father for quite a while
before he died and that Mr. Peters's
father wasn't very well off and was
very hard to live pleasantly with on account
of Mr. Stowell's father, who lived
next door and was very well off and very
easy for Mr. Peters's mother to get along
with always; Mr. Peters's father died<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
when Mr. Peters was about twelve years
old, and just as soon as it was perfectly
ladylike, Mr. Peters's mother married
Mr. Stowell's father and went next door
to live and had Mr. Stowell. Lee says
Mr. Stowell's father never liked Mr.
Peters much because he reminded him
of all those years that Mr. Peters's and
Mr. Stowell's mother lived next door
instead of living with him; but Lee says
Mr. Peters is very clever, and he saw how
much his father lost from not being easy
to get along with, and so he made up
his mind to be easy to get along with
himself. He gets along so well with
Mr. Stowell that they travel together
all the time, and Lee says he told him
that if he could get along well with
Uncle he'd make it well worth his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
while; so he's getting along beautifully
with Uncle, and Lee is making it ever
so well worth his while.</p>

<p>Clara Kingsley has fallen in love with
one of the men who came with Mrs.
Brewer&mdash;the tall, dark one, who does
not talk much and reads German in his
room most of his time. There are so
many that I get names mixed, but Emily
Kingsley is the same as ever, and <i>such</i> a
joy to meet again. She says she doesn't
fall in love the way Clara does; she only
gets badly spattered. The two Tripps
are both devoted to Emily, and I think
they are all sort of keeping along together.
Miss Clara Emily asked after
every one in our family, even Aunt Jane.
Of course I told her that Aunt Jane had
been dead two years, and you ought to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
have seen her jump and look at Uncle.
She asked me if Uncle lived alone in the
house, and she looked so reflective that
I felt quite uncomfortable. I told Lee
about it, but he says Uncle must take
his chances the same as the rest of the
world when it comes to Miss Clara
Emily. I wish Lee wouldn't make
light of anything so serious as the way
Miss Clara Emily looked reflective.
You know you wouldn't like her having
all Aunt Jane's lace, and I'm sure
that after Uncle was completely married
to her, he wouldn't like it at all, either.
I don't know what Mrs. Brewer is,
but the men that came in the automobile
with her are just devoted to her, and
she makes every one have a good time.
We played cards and Consequences all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
the afternoon, and Mrs. Brewer told our
fortunes from tea-leaves in the evening.
She told Uncle to beware of a long,
pointed nose which she saw in his cup,
and Miss Clara Emily didn't know
whether to be mad or glad. She saw
a wedding-ring in Lee's cup, and I
blushed terribly and tried to cough, and
sneezed instead; and Lee said it was an
automobile tire, and meant a breakdown.
I do think Lee is always so
nice. But about eleven we all got a
terrible shock, for the handsome man
that Clara has fallen in love with suddenly
came to the door with his German
book in his hand and said to Mrs.
Brewer, "Come to bed, Bert. I'm
sleepy as the devil."</p>

<p>You never saw anything like poor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
Clara! I thought that she would faint,
for you know when Clara falls in love
how it goes all through her. She went
upstairs a little later, and, as luck would
have it, she had the next room to the
Brewers, and she says it just about killed
her to hear him brushing his teeth, and
I promised her I'd never tell, but she
says he called her and Emily the "Yellow
Kids" and laughed and laughed
and laughed. I do think it was very
horrid of him, for they can't help having
Mr. Kingsley's ears, and I comforted
Clara all I could, and told her that the
way she puffs her hair is ever so becoming.
It isn't a bit, but I had to be as
nice as I knew how, for she was crying
so that I was afraid Mr. Brewer would
call her <i>Cyrano de Bergerac</i>, if she didn't<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
stop.</p>

<p>I had the room between Uncle and the
two Tripps, and the two Tripps calculated
their money for three solid hours,
I do believe, trying to see whether
they'd have to draw on Paris behind
them or could wait for London ahead.
The big Tripp said Mr. Peters had a
hard row to hoe and the little Tripp said
Lee had a soft snap, and then they
added and subtracted and divided for
another hour. I was almost insane
when finally the little Tripp said: "Tell
me what fifteen times nine is, and then
I'll go to sleep," and someone across
the hall hollered: "In Heaven's name
tell him what fifteen times nine is, and
then we'll <i>all</i> go to sleep." There was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
deadly stillness after that.</p><br>


<p class="center">(NEXT DAY)</p>
<p class="rthead"><i>Vire.</i></p>


<p><span class="smcap">Dearest Mama</span>:</p>

<p>You see, we are still here and it is
still raining. Every one telegraphed for
mail yesterday and every one got it to-day.
I had your letters and one from
Edna and one from Mrs. Clary. They
are going on a coaching trip with the
man who wasn't a duke, and Edna has
bought three new hats. Mrs. Clary
says I am an angel and that she and
Edna think it right out of Heaven
the way Lee has turned up. I had three
letters from Mr. Edgar, and he says he
is thinking of making a trip into Brittany<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
and joining us. I told Lee, and
Lee says he isn't thinking anything of
the kind, not in his life. I don't really
think that Mr. Edgar and Lee would
get on very well together. I feel almost
sure that they wouldn't like each
other. Indeed, I feel quite sure.</p>

<p>Poor Clara came to my room while
I was reading letters, and she says she is
blighted by Mr. Brewer and knows she
can never get over it. She says she
wouldn't have him know that she has
the next room and can hear every word
for anything, for she says it's perfectly
awful all she's overhearing. She says
he called Mrs. Brewer "Ladybug," and
it sounded so sweet that she cried for
fifteen minutes with the pillow around
her head to keep them from hearing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
her. I'm awfully sorry about Clara,
because she is always so sincere. Don't
you remember that time that she was
so sincere that they were afraid that she
would commit suicide over Cleever
Wiggins&mdash;and that awfully sincere time
she had with young Prof. Cook? She
says she could stand anything if she
could feel that she was reciprocated; but
she says she can't feel that Mr. Brewer
reciprocates one bit, for he told his
wife that he bet Clara would be an
older maid than her aunt before she got
through with life, and Clara says that's
no compliment, however you work it.</p>

<p>When we went down-stairs, Mr. Peters
and Uncle were playing poker and
Miss Clara Emily was sitting by them
looking rapt. Heavens! I do hope it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
will stop raining and let us get away
soon, for Uncle told me this noon that
she was more unlike Aunt Jane than
any woman that he had seen in years.
Lee says he hopes we can get away very
soon, too; he does not like Ellsworth
Grimm. It is a pity, because Ellsworth
has grown so nice, and with his pointed
beard he is really very handsome. He
has done a beautiful sketch of me that
every one but Lee thinks is splendid,
and I'm going to send it to you when
it is finished. Uncle is very good-tempered,
and has won over a hundred and
fifty francs from Mr. Peters at poker.
Mr. Peters says he's played poker for
years without meeting such a rattling
winner as Uncle, and Uncle believes
him. The two Tripps want to go on,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
too, because they decided to wait for
their money at London, and they are
afraid they are going to run short. Mr.
Brewer wants to go, too, because he has
finished his German book. I think we all
want to go, because two days is a long
while to spend in Vire. Clara says if they
cannot go on in the automobile, she must
take a train, for she is getting more and
more sincere the more she is hearing
Mr. Brewer talking to his wife through
the wall. Clara says he said that he was
going to snip her nose off when they
were dressing this morning, and she says
he calls her "Puss" till Clara feels as
if she should expire in agony. She
doesn't get any sympathy from Emily,
because Emily has another room, and
Emily isn't sincere, anyhow. Emily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
has thrown over the two Tripps and
taken Mr. Stowell, and thrown over
Mr. Stowell and gone back to the big
Tripp, all in just these two days. Emily
asked me if I ever saw such a fool as
Clara; she says it almost kills her to
have such a sister and such an aunt.
She asked me if I'd noticed her aunt
looking at my Uncle, and I had to say
yes. Then she said she did hope that
it would stop raining pretty soon, for
she wants to get to Granville and meet
a man and get letters from three more.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span></p>
</div>

<p>Uncle came into my room this afternoon
noon and said the more he saw of
Europe the better he liked it, and that
Mr. Peters was the sort of friend that
was worth making. He said he had decided
to go on with them to Mont<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
St. Michel, because they were so urgent
that he couldn't well get out of it.
He says he hopes I won't consider that
he has changed his opinion of Lee because
he hasn't, but that he will say
this much, and that is, that the fact
that a man like Mr. Peters will call
Lee his friend proves that he must have
some good in him somewhere. Uncle
said the Kingsleys seem to be nice girls,
and then he coughed, but I didn't
say anything, so he dropped the subject.
I must tell you, though, that Miss Clara
Emily is getting very much in earnest,
and every one is noticing it, and Uncle
seems pleased.</p>

<p>We all played cards to-day and wrote
letters and Lee told Ellsworth Grimm
he was a blank idiot under his breath.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
I don't know what was the trouble,
and Lee says it isn't any of my business,
but I think we are all getting cross from
being shut up so much in this little
country hotel. Elfrida and her sister
arrived about noon, but there wasn't
any spare room under two francs, and
so they went to the other hotel. Ellsworth
Grimm has gone to the other
hotel, too. He says it rains in his
ceiling and he's afraid he'll get pneumonia.</p>

<p>It's getting awful about poor Clara
and Mr. Brewer, for he said something
about her to-day that almost killed her,
and that is so bad that she won't repeat
it to me. She says Mrs. Brewer just
shrieked with laughter over it, and told
him he was the dearest, horridest thing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
alive. Clara says I cannot possibly
guess the torture of being sincere over
a married man who howls with laughter
over you in the next room. She says
she can't help hearing, and she's taken
an awful cold standing with her ear to
the wall, too. Poor Clara!</p>

<p>Emily and the big Tripp went out
and walked in the rain most all the
afternoon, and I thought she must be
very fond of him to be willing to get
so wet; but she says all she's done here
she's done to make Jim Freeman
jealous. I was so surprised when she
told me that, for Jim has spent the
entire two days with the chauffeur
under the automobile. They have
only come out to eat and sleep, and if
he is in love with Emily, he is certainly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
taking it easy.</p><br>

<p class="rthead"><i>Vire</i> (<i>12 M. next day</i>).</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Oh, Mama</span>, we are so tired of this
place! Clara has cried herself sick,
and her aunt sent for the doctor. Mr.
and Mrs. Brewer heard through the
wall when he came, and heard that it
was Clara, and of course they knew that
Clara must have heard them just as well
as they could hear the doctor, and they
nearly went crazy. Mrs. Brewer came
to me in a sort of mad despair and said
Mr. Brewer was almost wild. She says
she has mimicked Clara and Emily and
their aunt over and over, and she never
dreamed that the wall was so thin. She
says Mr. Brewer talks all the time he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
dresses and undresses and says anything
that comes into his head. They felt
perfectly unable to face Clara again, and
it was raining so hard that they couldn't
go on, so they moved over to the other
hotel.</p><br>

<p class="rthead"><i>Vire</i> (<i>2 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> same day</i>).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">It's</span> very funny, but it seems that the
little Tripp was dreadfully taken with
Mrs. Brewer, so the two Tripps have
moved over to the other hotel, too. Mr.
Stowell and Emily want to go, too, but
they are with parties, and cannot do as
they please. The big Tripp came
back for his soap, and said he had a fireplace
and now Uncle wants to move,
too.</p><br>

<p><span class="smcap">We</span> did move, and Lee said if we
went, he was going. So he and Mr.
Peters and Mr. Stowell have come over.
So we are all here except the Kingsleys
and Jim Freeman. I had to go back
for Uncle's soap, and the little Tripp
left his pajamas, so we went back together
to get both, and poor Clara is
delirious, screaming, "Yellow kids, yellow
kids!" every minute. Every one
thinks she is thinking of shopping in
Paris, and I didn't explain; but while
we were there, Mr. Brewer came back
for their soap and heard Clara, and, as
a result, he and his wife went on in their
automobile, rain or no rain. They left
one of their men named Scott McCarthy,
and took Ellsworth Grimm.
Ellsworth wanted to go, and Scott<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
wanted to stay, so it happened very
nicely.</p><br>

<p class="rthead"><i>Vire</i> (<i>6 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> same day</i>).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">They</span> have just moved Clara over
here. She had a fresh fit when she
heard Mr. Brewer getting the soap, and
Miss Clara Emily thought that a
change of scene would benefit her; so
they all moved over. Emily told me
(I walked over with Emily when she
went back to get their soap) that it
really wasn't Clara at all: it was that
her aunt wanted to keep close to my
Uncle. Isn't it awful? And Uncle
is so flattered, too! I do hope that it
will stop raining to-morrow. Lee
doesn't like Scott McCarthy, and it is
a pity, for he seems to be such a nice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
man. It's terribly dull without Mrs.
Brewer, she was so lively. Mr. Peters
is beginning to look real pale, and Lee
says he ought to have a monument to
patience erected to him. Jim Freeman
is worried over the automobiles; he's
afraid something will happen to them
on account of our all changing hotels.
Wouldn't that be terrible?</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">"W</span><span class="smcap">ell</span>, this is a great change
from the automobile&mdash;eh,
Peters? Of all the outrageous,
heathenish actions, that cutting
of automobile tires was the worst.
Every man at that hotel ought to be
hung up and high-strung and quartered&mdash;make
an example of the whole outfit.
I must say, though, that I blame
Freeman a good deal myself. He says
he felt anxious, and yet he never had
that chauffeur set up to watch. Foolish,
very foolish; but he'll pay the
penalty, having to stay there and wait for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
the tires from Caen.</p>

<p>"Lee, if you could withdraw yourself
somewhat from the window, perhaps
I could form some faint conception
of what the country looks like
to the north. If you and Yvonne want
to compare maps, I should suggest that
you sit side by side instead of holding
the map so that it completely covers
my horizon.</p>

<p>"Well, Peters, and so here we are
off for Dol. Dol seems to be the only
way to get in or out of Brittany and it
must have been so always, for in Matilda's
tapestry she's got William and
Harold on their way to Dol as a
beginning to making things hot for the
Lord of Brittany. Very interesting
study, that tapestry, Peters. I wouldn't<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
have&mdash;</p>

<p>"Stowell, I beg your pardon, but
those are my feet, and not valises,
that you are going to sleep against. I
didn't say anything as long as you took
them as they lay, but now that you
want my left foot slanting to the right,
I must protest. Suppose you end yourself
the other way for a change, anyhow.</p>

<p>"Well, Peters, and so we are off for
Mont-Saint-Michel, bless her old heart&mdash;or
is Michel a him? I must say,
I'm deeply interested in to-day's expedition.
Wasn't some English Henry
shut up on Mont-Saint-Michel and fed
by ravens there, or something like that?
Yes; I know there's some such legend,
and now we're going to see the spot.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
How do we get from Dol to the mont?
By Pontorson, eh? And then diligence
the rest. Well, I must say it sounds
like quite an undertaking; but then, if
you leave the beaten path, you must
always pay the price, and I must say I
enjoy these little jaunts with a congenial
party. Too bad the Kingsleys couldn't
have continued with us. Nice people,
the Kingsleys&mdash;very interesting girls.
What did you say? Oh, yes, of course
the aunt was interesting, too; but&mdash;what
did you say? Nonsense, nonsense!
But I will say one thing, Peters,
and that is that it pays to travel around
when it brings one in contact with
people such as yourself and Miss
Kingsley.</p>

<p>"So this is Pontorson! Do we get
down here? Is that the diligence? Do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
we get up there? Great Scott! how can
we? And it looks to be about full already.
Do you mean that we have got
to climb that little ladder? I don't believe
Yvonne can. I don't believe she
ought to, even if she can. Can't we go
to Mont-Saint-Michel some other way?
Peters, I'd like to slay with my own
hands that wretch that slashed our automobile.
Will you think of the difference
he is making in our comfort these
days?</p>

<p>"Well, Stowell, let's see you skin up
there first. Looks easy, don't it, Peters?
Lee, you go next. Now, Peters, it's
your turn. And now, Yvonne, my
child, steady, and start and keep right
on to the end. There&mdash;there&mdash;catch
her on top anywhere, Peters. Got her?
Are you all right, child? And now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
for your Uncle John!</p>

<p>"Ask him if this is a new ladder. I
don't want to take any chances with an
old ladder, you know. Well, what did
he say? Ask him if people ever do
fall or meet with any sort of accidents
going up. Well, what did he say?
Peters, this looks more serious every
minute. What do they have the thing
so high for, anyhow? I must say I
don't like going up there at all. Ask
him if he has ever known anyone to
miss their footing? Well, tell him to
keep a good grip on the ladder. Now
then, one, two,&mdash;oh, this is&mdash;confound
him! tell him to steady it&mdash;Great
Scott! Landed!</p>

<p>"And now that I am up, tell me
how in all creation I'm ever to get<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
down again.</p>

<p>"Well, why don't we start? That's
the worst of Europe, Peters&mdash;no push,
no energy. Perfectly content to sit
on a diligence and stagnate. Let
me look at my watch. Eleven.
Well, I'm not at all surprised. I
wouldn't be surprised at anything that
might occur in this vicinity. I tell
you, Peters, it will be a glad day for
me when I set my foot down hard on
a New York steamer pier once more.
I can't but feel&mdash;</p>

<p>"Ah, so we are to get under way at
last! Lumbering old concern&mdash;eh,
Peters? Great contrast to the automobile&mdash;Lee,
as there may be some one
speaking English within a mile of us,
I would suggest that you lower your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
voice a trifle and give the other fellow
a chance. What? I don't catch what
you say? Speaking to <i>me</i>? Who's
speaking to me? <i>You?</i> Well, what
do you want to say to me? I'm right
here to be spoken to, and from the outlook
I should fancy that I was going
to be right here for an indefinite length
of time. Well, what is it? The Brewers!
Where? Ahead there? How do you
know? Are you sure? What do you
think, Peters? Yes, that's them.
Brewer seems to be underneath the
machine. Well, what shall we do?
Wave and holler? We can't do anything
else if we want to. But they
are going to be a good deal surprised to
see us perched aloft like this. Yes;
there's Mrs. Brewer sitting on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
bank with McCarthy and the other
man. I'd rather be the guests than
the owner when it comes to an automobile
any day.</p>

<p>"Well, why don't you holler, Lee?
That's it&mdash;make a trumpet out of your
hands and just give it to them. Gee!
but they are surprised! Holler that we
are going to Mme. Poulard Ainé. I
suppose that they're going there, too,
anyway; no one ever goes anywhere else.
Dear me! but they're happy to have
that automobile. Lucky for them that
they went on just when they did.
There's Brewer crawling out from
under. Well, I can't stay twisted any
longer, so we'll turn our eyes once
more to the future.</p>

<p>"What's that ant-hill out at sea? It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
isn't the sea, though, is it? It's land;
gray sand, I vow. And so that is Mont-Saint-Michel?
Curious. Used to be on
land, eh, and then got to be on sea? It
appears to me that we have quite a drive
before us yet. Looks to me to be three
or four miles. What do you say,
Peters? Of course I don't know, how
big the mont is, so I have nothing to
judge the distance by; but I should say
three miles at least.</p>

<p>"Stowell, I've heard that story you
are telling ever since I was born; who
ever told you that it was new ought to
be shot. This tendency to tell old
stories is a perfect vice with some people,
Peters, and that brother of yours is forever
doing it. I've heard him tell
about calling the cabman a pig in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>
France and asking him if he was engaged
in Germany until I'm about to
the end of my patience. Great Scott!
how hot the sun is, and no matter how
gaily we lumber along, the mont looks
to be equally distant. What is this road
we're on, anyway? Seems to be a highway
in the most literal sense of the
word. Dike, eh? Built on purpose
for tourists, I suppose&mdash;the American
tourists before all, I'll bet.</p>

<p>"Well, so that is the mont close to.
Appears to just comfortably cover up the
whole island. Curious collection of
houses and staircases topped off by a
church. However, my main care at
this moment isn't what we've come to
see, but how in thunder we're to get
down to see it. Well, the people line<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
up pretty thick, and they have the additional
joy of knowing that every last
one of us is a tourist. That's one good
thing about America, Peters, you can
travel there without being a tourist.
You pay a stiff price for very little, but
that little's good, and the game ends
with it. Europe's entirely different:
what turns on the light over the wash-stand
turns it off over the bed, and then,
with all that, they mark light extra in
the bill. There don't seem to be any
legitimate hotel comforts here: they're
all extra. I vow, I hate to take that
hard-wood bolster out from under my
head nights, for it's the one thing I get
for nothing in every hotel.</p>

<p>"Well, Yvonne, I think you'd better
go down first. You go next, Stowell,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
and then you, Lee. You and I, Peters,
will wait and take our time. I vow,
I'm not very keen on this descent.
Just hold my hat, will you? Here,
you, down there, hold this ladder steady.
Peters, I&mdash;where's the next step?
Peters, you&mdash;where's the bottom? I
vow I&mdash;</p>

<p>"Safe at last! quaint old place&mdash;old
wall with a gate in it, eh! Fishing-rods
and oars all about; when does the tide
come in? Faster than a horse can gallop,
eh? Well, that must be sad for
the horse. Anyhow, I didn't ask how
fast it came in; I asked when it would
come in next. Well, ask some one.
An hour after we leave, eh? Interesting.
But come on; let's go up to
Mme. Poulard Ainé and eat the omelet,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
and then we can climb around some.
You walk on, Yvonne, and order the
luncheon, and Mr. Peters and I will
come leisurely after. Yes, my niece is
a pretty girl, Peters, but nothing but a
child&mdash;nothing but a child. No more
idea of worldliness than a cat has of a
cactus; a great responsibility to travel
with&mdash;a great responsibility. Between
you and me, I used to suspect young
Reynolds of paying her attention; but
when he took another ship over, and then
left Paris before we arrived, I saw my
suspicions had been wrong. I said a
thing or two about him to Yvonne, and
she took it perfectly placidly, so then I
saw that it was all off. I don't like to
run down a friend of yours, Peters,&mdash;and
I suppose he must be a friend of yours<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
or you wouldn't have him along with
you,&mdash;but you're old enough to see
that he hasn't got the stuff in him to
make any girl happy. He's too&mdash;too&mdash;well,
I can't just express it, but I
know that you understand. It takes
peculiar attributes to make a woman
happy. Now, take me for example.
My wife and I were very happy; she
always knew just what was expected of
her, and she always did it. It followed
naturally that&mdash;</p>

<p>"And so this is the famous omelet-place.
Well, in we go. Quaint&mdash;very
quaint. Look at the chickens turning
on the spit and dripping in a trough.
My, but they look good! Mme. Poulard
herself, isn't it? Good day, ma'am;
bon jour&mdash;bon jour. Glory, what a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
smile, stereoscoped and illuminated!
Makes me think of the china cat's head
that we used to put a candle inside of
when I was a kid. Do we go upstairs?
Eat up there, eh? Quaint&mdash;very quaint.
Every fellow did what he pleased to
these walls, evidently. Well, Peters,
let's sit down."</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">And</span> so we now set out to climb
Mont-Saint-Michel. Picturesque flight
of steps. No, I don't mind climbing&mdash;good
exercise. Curious little winding
walk; old woman with baskets to
sell. No, we don't want any; go 'way,
go 'way. Terrible nuisance such
people. Here's another with yellow
flowers. No, no, go 'way, you&mdash;and
another with matches. No, no, go<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
'way. Well, that's a pretty tall flight
of steps, isn't it, Peters? But I guess
we can make it. Where's Yvonne?
Ahead, eh? Well, I presume those
two fellows can look out for her.
Curious about the Brewers not turning
up; suppose he's under the automobile
yet? Wonder how Freeman is getting
on in Vire. Let's stop and look at the
view. Fine view! As I was saying,
Peters, it was too bad the way we
broke up at Vire. I really felt mean
over leaving as we did. What did you
say? Nonsense; none of that, Peters,
none of that. But I will say one thing
for her: she certainly was a woman of
great perception&mdash;always thoughtful
for others. Did you notice how she
used to push the ash-receiver toward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
me? It's things like that that make a
man comfortable. Astonishing that such
a woman should never marry. Well,
let's go on. Not more than ninety more
steps and two flower women to get
over. Peters, have you observed how
many stairs there are in Europe? It
fairly bristles with them. We go
pretty nearly stair-free with us, and
over here it's stairs from dawn till&mdash;</p>

<p>"Great Scott, will you look at them!
Oh, I never can go up there, never!
We may as well go back. If you
want to, you can go up; but I couldn't
possibly see anything that would compensate
me for those steps. I'll bet
there are ten thousand, and like as not
there are more beyond. I'm going
back and sit with Mme. Poulard Ainé<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>
till it's time to go. You go on alone.
Just tell him we don't want any of
those oyster-shell pincushions first, will
you? Then you go on by yourself,
Peters, I've had enough."</p><br>

<p><span class="dropcap">D</span><span class="smcap">earest Mama</span>: We are
all here together again except
the Brewers and the two
Tripps and Ellsworth Grimm. It is
very jolly, only I am so worried over
Uncle and Miss Clara Emily. Even
Mr. Peters cannot keep them apart.
Lee took Mr. Peters to his room and
talked to him seriously, and offered to
make Uncle still more worth his while;
but Mr. Peters has been agreeable so
long that he doesn't do it well any
more. He just looks silly, and Lee<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
says if he was us he'd let Uncle go
rip. But of course Lee isn't us, and I
know that he can't be expected to
know just how we feel. If Uncle John
marries Miss Clara Emily, I know no
one is going to like it  at all.</p>

<span class="caption">In Mont-Saint-Michel</span>
</div>

<p>We went to Mont-Saint-Michel, and
every one but Uncle went up, and he
went seven flights up&mdash;he <i>says</i> twenty,
but I don't believe that there are more
than sixteen or seventeen in all. We
were ahead, and never knew that he had
stopped being behind, and it was so interesting
on top that I forgot I had an
uncle. There are beautiful halls and
cloisters, and then one goes down
through all sorts of horrors while the
guide tells who lived five years in this
hole and who lived twelve years under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
those steps. You get to have such a
contempt for people who were in
prison only one or two years over here&mdash;as
if they ought to be ashamed of only
having been in such a short time.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
There is a ghostly, ghastly museum in
Mont-Saint-Michel where the visitors
walk through an unlighted gallery and
look in at wax victims doing different
things in a very thoughtful manner&mdash;all
but one man who walked on the sand
and was overtaken by the tide, and <i>he</i>
looks anything but thoughtful. The
best was the battle, which was very
realistic and must have been very trying
to the leaders; for how could they get
absorbed in a fight when the tide would
drown them if they kept on a minute
too long? There was a man who
thought he would escape, and dug a
way out with his nails, taking a short
life-time to the task; and then he found
he'd dug in instead of out, and, after letting
himself down with a rope, he came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
to a bottom all covered with skeletons.
I can assure you that I was glad we were
all together and that Lee had my arm
tight, for the scenes were awful, and I
grew so sick toward the last that when
we came down at the end and found
Uncle sitting on the ramparts with Miss
Clara Emily, I nearly screamed. They
had all come while we were above, and
Emily and some men were out walking
on the sand. Clara is somewhat better;
but I think she is even more sincere
than usual this time. In her locket
she has some plaster from the wall that
she heard through, and she says she
sleeps with it pressed to her lips. And
I <i>know</i> that Miss Clara Emily is going
to do everything in the world to get
Uncle, for Emily says she was traveling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
just with a little hand-satchel, and now
she insists on a suit-case. Oh, dear, I
don't know what to do; and Lee is
tired of the situation, and wants to go
yachting, and I want to go with him.
It would be so lovely off yachting with
Lee; and the yacht is anchored where
we can see her from the city walls.
Lee is forever pointing to her. He
says Mr. Stowell would let him have
her for a month, any day.</p>

<p>We passed the Brewers on our way to
Mont-Saint-Michel, but they must have
seen the Kingsleys and gone back.
Mrs. Brewer told me in Vire that they
could never meet the Kingsleys again;
she said that Mr. Brewer said if he
should meet Clara he knew he should
explode. I don't think that Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
Brewer has much heart or he never
would have called poor Clara a Yellow
Kid; I've known Clara ever since I
was a baby, and it never struck me that
she looked like that till she told me
that Mr. Brewer said so.</p>
<p>We all took the tram-ride to Rocabey
yesterday, but one is so afraid that a
wave will wash over the car and drench
every one with spray that it isn't much
fun. The tide is so funny all along
this coast, because the coast is so level
that a foot of water covers a mile or so,
and when a wave starts to come in
there's nothing to stop it at all. I
don't think that St. Malo is very interesting,
but perhaps that is just Uncle
and Miss Clara Emily. He sends her
violets, and I know it is he, for it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
couldn't be Mr. Peters or Mr. Stowell,
and it wouldn't be Jim Freeman or
Scott McCarthy. She wears them
pinned on in such a funny way.</p>

<p class="center">(NEXT DAY)</p>

<p class="rthead"><i>St. Malo.</i></p>


<p><span class="smcap">Dearest Mama</span>: Edna has sent me
the letter about your coming over, and
I am so relieved. Perhaps you will
get here in time to save Uncle from
Miss Clara Emily; I do hope so.
Edna's things must be lovely, and I
read her letter to Lee. He says if
I'm good I will have some things of
my own some day, and I do hope so;
but Uncle is so heavy on my mind that
I cannot realize that I shall ever have
any life except trying to keep him from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>
Miss Clara Emily. Mr. Peters is no
good at all any more, and has a bad cold
besides. He and Clara sit on the ramparts
and gaze at the sea, and look as if
they were two consolation prizes that
the people who won didn't care
enough about to take home with them.
Lee says he never realized that Mr.
Peters could peter out quite so completely.
Lee wants to go yachting,
and wants me to go, too, and I can't
leave Uncle, and Uncle won't leave
Miss Clara Emily. It's quite stupid
here at St. Malo, and we want to go on;
but Lee won't go on, and I'd rather
stay in a stupid place with Lee than go
anywhere without him. He's mad
over the Kingsleys tagging along, because
he likes Scott McCarthy less
and less all the time. Scott walks on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
the other side of me sometimes, and
Lee doesn't like it. I think land is
getting on Lee's nerves, and he ought
to go yachting; but life is such a tangle
just now that I don't know what to do
about anything. Miss Clara Emily is
hemstitching a handkerchief, and I just
know that it is for Uncle. Oh, dear.</p><br>

<p class="center">(NEXT DAY)</p>
<p class="rthead"><i>St. Malo.</i></p>


<p><span class="smcap">Dearest Mama</span>: Such an awful thing
almost happened! Clara had a nightmare,
and came near choking to death
on Mr. Brewer's plaster&mdash;the locket,
you know. Uncle says only a prompt,
efficient, quick-witted, thoroughly capable
nature like Miss Clara Emily's could
have saved her. Oh, I just know he's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>
becoming serious, and Lee says it's just
tommy-rot about the efficiency, because
all in the world that Miss Clara Emily
did was to jerk the locket up by the
chain; and she did that in such an
awfully quick way that poor Clara says
she's cured of Mr. Brewer forever.
She will have to eat soup through a
china straw for several days.</p>

<p>Uncle wants to go to Carnac and see
the ruins of the Stone Age, and he and
Miss Clara Emily are mapping out a
trip. I'm sure I don't know what I'll
do, for Scott McCarthy has bet Mr.
Stowell ten dollars that Uncle gets
"hooked" in Carnac. Lee told me, and
Lee himself is provisioning the yacht,
and says he's cock-sure that he eats
some of those provisions aboard of her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>
himself. Emily doesn't want to go to
Carnac, and Jim Freeman says it isn't
any automobile country, on account of
the relics of the Stone Age being so
thick in the roads.</p><br>


<p class="center">(NEXT DAY)</p>
<p class="rthead"><i>St. Malo.</i></p>


<p><span class="smcap">Dearest Mama</span>: Why didn't you
write me that Mrs. Whalen was coming
abroad? She arrived last night on
the Jersey boat, and saw Uncle and
Miss Clara Emily on the ramparts
through her marine glasses. She hunted
us up at once, for she says that affair
must stop right where it is. She asked
if you approved of Lee, and when I
told her that you did, she said then she
had nothing to say. Lee introduced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>
her to Mr. Peters, and she sent him
straight to bed and had them poultice
his chest and mustard-plaster his back,
for she says his cold may run into anything.
I took her up to Clara, and she
sent out for sweet oil, and stopped the
china straw, and set her to gargling.
She says it's awful the amount she
finds to do everywhere she goes, and
she was in a train accident before she
came to the steamer, and you ought to
hear how she chopped people out. The
shade in my room didn't work, and she
put a chair on a wash-stand, and fixed
it with a screw-driver that she carries
in her pocket. Jim Freeman wants her
to go under the automobile with him;
but she says since she's a widow she
never goes anywhere alone with one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>
man. Uncle and Miss Clara Emily
came in just then, and the effect was
paralyzing. Uncle turned red, and poor
Miss Clara Emily nearly sank to the
floor. Mrs. Whalen advanced toward
them as if she were a general leading a
cavalry charge afoot, and said: "Well,
so the old folks have been out sunning
themselves!" Did you ever hear of
anything more cruel? Miss Clara
Emily looked blue with rage, and said
she must go to Clara, and Mrs. Whalen
said: "John, come with me," and took
Uncle off behind some palms, and Lee
and I went away so as not to be anywhere
when he came out.</p>

<p>We didn't come back until nearly
six, and Lee said he supposed we'd
find Uncle and Mr. Peters learning to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>
play "old maid"; but when we came
in, Uncle was reading a New York
paper about a month old, and Mrs.
Whalen had gone out with Scott
McCarthy to buy Clara a hot-water
bag. Miss Clara Emily was upstairs
packing, to take Clara to a specialist
somewhere else. Mrs. Whalen came
to my room after dinner, and said I
must rub kerosene or vaseline into my
hair every night for a month. I don't
want to, but I'm so grateful about Uncle
that I'll pour a lamp over myself if she
wants me to. Uncle came to my room
a while later and said: "Hum!" and
shook his watch, and held it to his ear.
I don't think he liked being broken up
with Miss Clara Emily, but he only
said that he was going out on the yacht<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>
to-morrow (that's to-day), and for me
to consider myself in Mrs. Whalen's
charge for the time being.</p>

<p>He went away early this morning
with Mr. Peters and Jim Freeman and
Lee, and Mrs. Whalen and I saw the
Kingsleys off for Rennes at noon. I'm
sure Miss Clara Emily felt dreadfully
over Uncle, and Emily says she's more
than ever ashamed of having such an
aunt. Emily told me that if an Englishman
came on this afternoon's boat from
Jersey, to tell him they'd gone to Dol.
She didn't want him in Rennes, because
she knows two French officers in
Rennes. It was not a very nice day
for traveling, for there is such a wind
they won't be able to have the windows
down at all, and you know it's only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>
fun when you have the windows down.
Mrs. Whalen says she'd have the
windows down anyway; she says she'd
like to see the Frenchman that she
wouldn't put a window down in his
face, if she felt like it. I asked her
where she was going next, and she said
she had no idea, but she thought to
Dol and Mont-Saint-Michel, as long as
she is so near. She says it was a stroke
of luck her happening here just in time
to save Uncle; she's positive he was
holding her hand through the marine
glasses. She says it's good she came
about Mr. Peters, too, not to speak of
Clara.</p>

<p>It keeps blowing more, and Scott
McCarthy says that they'll be out all
night. Lee will like that, and Uncle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>
won't, and Uncle will see that Lee likes
it and then he won't like Lee. Oh,
dear! But I mustn't mind anything
as long as Miss Clara Emily is gone.</p>

<p>Mrs. Whalen has just come in to say
that she's going to Dol, so as to see the
tide come in at Mont-Saint-Michel,
and to measure out the ginger so I can
make Mr. Peters the tea. I'm sure
I'm glad she is going, for she makes
me so tired and nervous, always hopping
up to fix something with her screw-driver,
and I want to wash the petroleum
out of my hair before Lee comes
back. He doesn't like the smell of
petroleum at all. I offered to help her
pack, but she doesn't pack. She wears
a sort of night-gown for underwaist and
petticoat together, and the front of her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>
blouse has pockets inside for all her
toilet things. She says she washes one
garment every night, and buys a clean
handkerchief each Saturday and Wednesday,
and has a pocket for her letter of
credit sewed to her corset. I think it
is awful to be so very convenient.</p><br>


<p class="rthead"><i>Later.</i></p>


<p>She went and never said a thing about
me, for it left me all alone with Scott
McCarthy, and I know Lee won't like
that at all. The mail came, and I
thought I'd better say I had a headache
and come up here to stay alone till Uncle
comes back. I had all your letters
and Edna's. Edna is so happy, and
everything goes so smooth for her and
Harry that I'm almost sorry some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>
days that I'm Uncle's favorite. Lee
wants to tell Uncle right out and be
done with it; but I want to wait for a
favorable time, and every time that
things begin to look favorable something
unexpected happens to make him
say "Hum." It is so trying. Edna
says she's getting a lot of things twice
over so that I can have half, and she says
she thinks we ought to be coming back
so as to meet you. I can't make her
understand how helpless I am, for I
can't do anything with Uncle unless
I'm alone with him enough to make
him think that I want to do something
else. And Lee thinks it is an outrage
and says he has rights, too. I do think
that if I didn't love Lee I would be
really glad to have the world all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>
women, men are so difficult to get
along with.</p>

<p>But, you know, no matter what I say,
I'm having a lovely time after all, and
I <i>am</i> grateful to Uncle for having
brought us.</p>

<p class="rtxhead"> Lovingly, </p>
<p class="rthead"> <span class="smcap">Yvonne.</span></p>

<p>P. S. It is ten o'clock, and the yacht
never came in. If Uncle gets seasick
in a storm, he'll never want to lay
eyes on Lee again, and he'll <i>never</i> forgive
me.</p><br>

<p><span class="dropcap">D</span><span class="smcap">ear Mama</span>: I'm just about
in despair, and Lee doesn't
know where I am. We
reached Carnac last night, and Uncle
is "hum-ming" like a top, so to speak.
But I must tell you all about it.</p>

<p>The yacht got too far out, and the
new thumb-screw, or whatever it is on
a yacht, stuck, and they blew and
pitched until they pitched on to the
Island of Jersey, where Lee and
Uncle went ashore for Lee to send a
machinist aboard. While Lee was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>
busy, Uncle just quietly went aboard
the Jersey boat and came back to St.
Malo without saying please or thank
you to a soul. He walked in on me
and told me we were to leave for Dol
the next day, and for Heaven's sake not
to remind him of Aunt Jane by asking
questions. I was dreadfully upset, but
of course I never thought for a minute
of reminding him of Aunt Jane, so I
packed that evening and left a letter
for Lee telling him please not to be
vexed. We took an early train for Dol
(it's always Dol in Brittany), and in
Dol we changed for Rennes. Of
course I thought that Uncle was chasing
Miss Clara Emily when I saw the
train marked Rennes, but I didn't dare
say a word, for he never spoke but once<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span>
between Dol and Rennes, and that time
all he said was "Hum."</p>

<span class="caption">A Street in Auray</span>
</div>

<p>We reached Rennes, and I thought
we would go to a hotel; but we
changed cars again&mdash;this time for Redon.
Uncle spoke again, and asked me if I
had the Gaelic grammar handy. I
said no, and he said "Hum." Then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>
we reached Redon and changed cars
again for Auray. Going to Auray,
Uncle asked me what became of Mrs.
Whalen, and when I told him that she
went to Mont-Saint-Michel, he said her
husband was a lucky man to be dead.
Then we came to Auray and changed
cars for Plouharnel, and I began to
wonder why we didn't run off the end
of Brittany into the sea. We reached
Plouharnel about four in the afternoon,
and took a tram for Carnac
at once, and when we reached Carnac
Uncle said to pardon the personality of
the statement, but that he never again
would try to keep up with the eternal
activity of a young person. I thought
that that was pretty hard when I didn't
even know where we were going, but I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>
didn't say anything, and when he went
to wash, I gave the waiter an extra tip
to feed us quickly. After Uncle ate,
we went out and walked around Carnac
a very little and saw all the people in
their black velvet hat-ribbons and short
jackets; but when I said they looked
picturesque, Uncle said that they looked
like darned fools, so we came home,
and now we are going to bed. I have
written Lee, but I don't know when he
will get it, because of course it will
have to go backward through all these
changes.</p>

<p class="center">(NEXT DAY)</p>
<p class="rthead"><i>Carnac.</i></p>


<p><span class="smcap">Dearest Mama</span>: Uncle woke up ever
so much better this morning, and told<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>
me that he pitied any poor wretch who
has ever been sicker than he was on
"that d&mdash;&mdash;d yacht." He said, too,
that any one who could suppose for a
minute that he should have any serious
intentions toward such a woman as Miss
Clara Emily would be even more of an
utter idiot than Mrs. Whalen appeared
to be. He said, too, that the ticket-agent
who told him that Carnac was
an easy place to go to, ought to be
strangled by the first traveler who got
back alive from the effects of believing
him to be telling the truth.
He said, too, that if he survived Europe
and reached home again, he'd get in
a bathtub and know when he was well
off for one while. He said, too, that
when he had once looked around the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span>
Stone Age he was going to head for
Paris with a speed which he rather
guessed would cause the natives to open
their eyes.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;">
<a name="gs33" id="gs33"></a>
<img src="images/gs33.png" width="300" height="417" alt="" title="">
<span class="caption">&quot;Broke the bell-rope ordering breakfast&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>Then he went to his room and broke<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>
the bell-rope ordering breakfast.</p>

<p>After breakfast we went to walk and
saw more stone walls than I ever saw
before. There isn't a wooden house or
fence in the whole of Brittany, I believe.
We walked to a tiny village
called St. Columban's, and climbed the
tower of the little church. There was
a fine view, but Uncle said he could
smell the oysters for miles around, so we
came down right off and walked back.
There was a girl who said she would
drive us all over in the afternoon, and
let us take the night train from Auray;
so we returned to the hotel and had an
early lunch, and then she came to the
door with a shaky old thing like a carry-all
and a fat little horse, and we started.</p>

<p>Mama, you never saw anything like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span>
Uncle. Everything was wrong at first&mdash;every
living thing, and the one saving
grace of the situation was that the girl
who drove couldn't speak English.
But after a while we came to the first
menhirs, and Uncle just about went
into a fit. They are the most curious
things I ever saw, for they stand in
parallel rows miles long and every one
is resting on its little end and has been
resting on its little end for thousands of
years. At the first glance Uncle said
they were arranged so just for tourists;
but he got out and walked around them
and tried to shake one or two, and then
he said he wouldn't have missed seeing
them for the world and that he should
never regret coming to Europe as long
as he might live hereafter. He was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span>
perfectly lovely for a while after that,
and we looked at dolmens and cromlechs
the whole afternoon, and sometimes
we thought they were hay-mows
when we saw them far ahead and
sometimes we thought they were
houses. We only had one unfortunate
time, and that was when we had to
ferry over the Crach. The ferry was
on the other side, and that upset Uncle
right away and he asked me if my experience
had ever led me to a ferry that
was <i>not</i> on the other side. They took
nearly half an hour to bring it across,
and Uncle said that it would be a great
day for Europe if she ever learned what
t-i-m-e spelt, and he looked at me as if
I were Europe while he said it. They
are building a bridge over the Crach,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span>
and as soon as we embarked on the
rickety old ferry, it blew in between
two of the piers and wedged tight, with
us on it. Uncle asked me if I was
going to have the face to tell him that
we were not stuck and were not going
to be stuck there indefinitely, and I
really didn't know <i>what</i> to answer.
The men in the boat hollered and hauled
and swore in Gaelic, and finally we
were free for fifty feet, and then the
tide blew us in between two other
piers. Uncle said he could but feel
that being stuck twice on the same
ferry was a poor reward for a kind-hearted
man who was trying to the
best of his ability to give some species
of instructive amusement to an innocent
girl, and then he looked severely at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span>
setting sun while we came loose again
and progressed fifty feet more. A great,
thick wave came then and broke over
the horse and smashed us in so hard and
fast that I was honestly scared. Uncle
was too mad for words. He said that
he would just make one remark, and
that was that if he ever gave me a
chance to beguile him away from civilization
again he would cheerfully and
contentedly and silently end his days on
any ferry which I would choose to
designate to him. It was getting cold,
and I was so tired from yesterday that
I just shut my eyes and did not speak
at all, and when we came loose, Uncle
spoke to me quite gently and was very
nice all the rest of the way.</p>

<p>We were too late for the train and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span>
have come back to Carnac. I feel
about done up.</p><br>


<p class="center">(NEXT DAY)</p>
<p class="rthead"><i>Carnac.</i></p>


<p><span class="smcap">Dearest Mama</span>: Lee and Edna and
Mrs. Clary are all here. Just listen.
Lee looks like a ghost, and it seems that
no one noticed Uncle go aboard that
Jersey boat because Uncle went aboard
by a gang-plank that's forbidden, and
he thought that he was drowned, and
they dragged the dock and sent down
divers, and finally came over to St.
Malo to break the news to me, having
telegraphed Mrs. Clary and Edna
to come at once. He reached St.
Malo only to find us gone, and they
have been tracing us with the automobile<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span>
ever since. Lee is so glad Uncle
is alive that he keeps grabbing his hand
and shaking it and shaking it, and Uncle
says I must not mention it to Lee, for
it might go to his head, but that he is
one of the few young men who have a
heart in the right place, and that he has
always had a special fondness for him
ever since he was a baby. Lee thinks
that under the circumstances we had
better tell Uncle to-night, and we are
going to. I feel rather nervous, but
Lee says he can never stand anything
like these three days again.</p><br>

<p><span class="smcap">My own dearest Mama</span>: Uncle says
yes! He says he has been carefully
scheming and planning to bring Lee<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span>
and me together for years. He says
there are traits in Lee which are so like
his own that he cannot but admit that
Lee is one of the very few men in this
world calculated to make a woman
happy. He told Mrs. Clary that he
had foreseen this finale to our trip all
along, and I do believe that he really
believes himself.</p>

<p>The Brewers arrived about nine
o'clock to-night, and they are so delighted.
Mr. Brewer is so kind; he says
Uncle must go to Locmariaquer and
around that way with them. I reckon
he thinks I need a rest. We told them
about Clara and the locket, and I
thought that they would die. Mr.
Brewer says that never a day passes
without their remembering something<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span>
fresh which she must have overheard.</p>

<p>I am so happy over Uncle that I
hardly know what to do. He says it
has been the pleasantest trip of his life,
this little tour with me, and that Lee
must never cease to treat me with the
tender care which he has given me all
along. He says Lee must remember
what a sensitive organization a woman
has and never indulge in temper or impatience
or strong language or sarcasm.
Lee is very nice and says "Yes, sir,"
and nods every time. I do think Lee
gets nicer and nicer all the time.</p>

<br>

<p><span class="dropcap">"W</span><span class="smcap">ell</span>, Mrs. Brewer, this is
certainly the only way to
travel, after all. Comfortable,
clean,&mdash;for if there is a smell, some other
fellow gets it,&mdash;and no jolting. And
now that I have that dear child established
and off my mind, I feel that I can
conscientiously give myself a few days of
free and easy pleasure. I've done
nothing up to now but consider Yvonne
and her needs, mental and material, and
although I love the child like my own,
still I cannot but admit that a young
girl is a great care. And of course you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span>
never can be positive that the right man
will turn up. However, all's well
that ends well, and I'm happy to say
that I'm ending this little trip extremely
well content. Some men might
regret not having seen more, but never
me. You see, Brewer, I am one of the
easy-going, placid, serene type, and
whatever turns up suits me perfectly. I
guess if you ask my family far and wide
you won't find one member to deny
that statement, or if you do, you will
just have the kindness to let me know
who it is and I'll take steps to prevent
their ever expressing such an opinion a
second time.</p>

<p>"Fine view here. Good road. Believe
I'll have a machine of my own when I

island off at sea? Belle-Isle, eh? Dumas'
Belle-Isle? Very interesting.
We might make a little excursion out
there, calling ourselves the Three
Mousquetaires, eh? I'll be d'Artagnan;
I always fancy d'Artdagnan. I tell
you, Brewer, something martial gets
up and stirs around in my bosom as a
result of this trip&mdash;a sort of dare-devil,
Robert-the-Devil, piratical, Crusader
sort of a thrill. I shall never be sorry
that I came. The trip has not been
one of unmitigated joy. We have
borne our crosses,&mdash;many crosses,&mdash;and
yet I will remark&mdash;and I'll swear it,
too, if you like,&mdash;that I'm glad I
came.</p>

I've been in. I've made my niece<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span>

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
